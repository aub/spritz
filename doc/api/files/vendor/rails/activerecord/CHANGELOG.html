*2.1.0 (May 31st, 2008)*
</p>
<ul>
<li>Add ActiveRecord::Base.sti_name that checks
ActiveRecord::Base#store_full_sti_class? and returns either the full or
demodulized name. [rick]

</li>
<li>Add first/last methods to associations/named_scope. Resolved 226. [Ryan
Bates]

</li>
<li>Added SQL escaping for :limit and :offset 288 [Aaron Bedra, Steven Bristol,

assume this is set if time_zone_aware_attributes is set to true [Geoff
Buesing]

</li>
<li>Time zone aware attribute methods use Time.zone.parse instead of to_time
for String arguments, so that offset information in String is respected.
Resolves 105. [Scott Fleckenstein, Geoff Buesing]

</li>
<li>Added change_table for migrations (Jeff Dean) [71]. Example:

<pre>
  change_table :videos do |t|
    t.timestamps                          # adds created_at, updated_at
    t.belongs_to :goat                    # adds goat_id integer
    t.string :name, :email, :limit =&gt; 20  # adds name and email both with a 20 char limit
    t.remove :name, :email                # removes the name and email columns
  end
</pre>
</li>
<li>Fixed has_many :through .create with no parameters caused a
&quot;can&#8216;t dup NilClass&quot; error (Steven Soroka) [85]

</li>

</li>
<li>Added that the MySQL adapter should map integer to either smallint, int, or
bigint depending on the :limit just like PostgreSQL [DHH]

</li>
<li>Change validates_uniqueness_of :case_sensitive option default back to true
(from [9160]). Love your database columns, don&#8216;t LOWER them. [rick]

<p>
Post.find(1).to_json # =&gt; {&quot;title&quot;: &#8230;}
config.active_record.include_root_in_json = true Post.find(1).to_json #
=&gt; {&quot;post&quot;: {&quot;title&quot;: &#8230;}}
</p>
</li>
<li>Add efficient include? to AssociationCollection (for has_many/has_many
:through/habtm). [stopdropandrew]

case it matches the name of some other non-ActiveRecord class/module.
[Rick]

</li>
<li>Try loading activerecord-&lt;adaptername&gt;-adapter gem before trying a
plain require so you can use custom gems for the bundled adapters. Also
stops gems from requiring an adapter from an old Active Record gem. [Jeremy
Kemper, Derrick Spell]

</li>
<li>Extract Firebird, FrontBase, and OpenBase adapters into gems. 9508, 9509,

8049 [roderickvd]

<pre>
      For more information see: http://dev.rubyonrails.org/ticket/8049
</pre>
</li>
<li>Don&#8216;t clobber includes passed to has_many.count [danger]

</li>
<li>Make sure has_many uses :include when counting [danger]

</li>
<li>Change the implementation of ActiveRecord&#8216;s attribute reader and
writer methods [nzkoz]

</li>
</ul>
<pre>
 - Generate Reader and Writer methods which cache attribute values in hashes.  This is to avoid repeatedly parsing the same date or integer columns.
 - Change exception raised when users use find with :select then try to access a skipped column.  Plugins could override missing_attribute() to lazily load the columns.
 - Move method definition to the class, instead of the instance
 - Always generate the readers, writers and predicate methods.
</pre>
<ul>
<li>Perform a deep dup on query cache results so that modifying activerecord
attributes does not modify the cached attributes. [Rick]

</li>
</ul>
<p>
# Ensure that has_many :through associations use a count query instead of
loading the target when size is called. Closes 8800 [Pratik Naik]
</p>
<ul>
<li>Added :unless clause to validations 8003 [monki]. Example:

<pre>
  def using_open_id?
    !identity_url.blank?
  end

  validates_presence_of :identity_url, :if =&gt; using_open_id?
  validates_presence_of :username, :unless =&gt; using_open_id?
  validates_presence_of :password, :unless =&gt; using_open_id?
</pre>
</li>
<li>Fix count on a has_many :through association so that it recognizes the
:uniq option. Closes 8801 [Pratik Naik]

</li>
<li>Fix and properly document/test count(column_name) usage. Closes 8999
[Pratik Naik]

</li>
<li>Remove deprecated count(conditions=nil, joins=nil) usage. Closes 8993
[Pratik Naik]

</li>
<li>Change belongs_to so that the foreign_key assumption is taken from the
association name, not the class name. Closes 8992 [hasmanyjosh]

<p>
OLD
</p>
<pre>
  belongs_to :visitor, :class_name =&gt; 'User' # =&gt; inferred foreign_key is user_id
</pre>
<p>
NEW
</p>
<pre>
  belongs_to :visitor, :class_name =&gt; 'User' # =&gt; inferred foreign_key is visitor_id
</pre>
</li>
<li>Remove spurious tests from deprecated_associations_test, most of these
aren&#8216;t deprecated, and are duplicated in associations_test. Closes
8987 [Pratik Naik]

</li>
<li>Make create! on a has_many :through association return the association
object. Not the collection. Closes 8786 [Pratik Naik]

</li>
<li>Move from select * to select tablename.* to avoid clobbering IDs. Closes
8889 [dasil003]

</li>
<li>Don&#8216;t call unsupported methods on associated objects when using
:include, :method with to_xml 7307, [manfred, jwilger]

</li>
<li>Define collection singular ids method for has_many :through associations.
8763 [Pratik Naik]

Manfred Stienstra, Josh Peek]

</li>
<li>Rollback if commit raises an exception. 8642 [kik, Jeremy Kemper]

</li>
<li>Update tests&#8217; use of fixtures for the new collections api. 8726
[Kamal Fariz Mahyuddin]

</li>
<li>with_scope is protected. 8524 [Josh Peek]

</li>
<li>Quickref for association methods. 7723 [marclove, Mindsweeper]

</li>
<li>Calculations: return nil average instead of 0 when there are no rows to

</li>
<li>acts_as_nested_set: direct_children is sorted correctly. 4761 [Josh Peek,
rails@33lc0.net]

</li>
<li>Raise an exception if both attr_protected and attr_accessible are declared.
8507 [stellsmi]

</li>

<li>Optimistic locking: revert the lock version when an update fails. 7840
[plang]

</li>
<li>Migrations: add_column supports custom column types. 7742 [jsgarvin,
Theory]

</li>
<li>Load database adapters on demand. Eliminates config.connection_adapters and
RAILS_CONNECTION_ADAPTERS. Add your lib directory to the $LOAD_PATH and put
your custom adapter in
lib/active_record/connection_adapters/adaptername_adapter.rb. This way you
can provide custom adapters as plugins or gems without modifying <a
href="../../../../classes/Rails.html">Rails</a>. [Jeremy Kemper]

</li>
<li>Ensure that associations with :dependent =&gt; :delete_all respect
:conditions option. Closes 8034 [danger, Josh Peek, Rick]

[fearoffish]

</li>
<li>Provide brief introduction to what optimistic locking is. [fearoffish]

</li>
<li>Add documentation for :encoding option to mysql adapter. [marclove]

</li>
<li>Added short-hand declaration style to migrations (inspiration from Sexy
Migrations, <a
href="http://errtheblog.com/post/2381">errtheblog.com/post/2381</a>) [DHH].
Example:

<pre>
  create_table &quot;products&quot; do |t|
    t.column &quot;shop_id&quot;,    :integer
    t.column &quot;creator_id&quot;, :integer
    t.column &quot;name&quot;,       :string,   :default =&gt; &quot;Untitled&quot;
    t.column &quot;value&quot;,      :string,   :default =&gt; &quot;Untitled&quot;
    t.column &quot;created_at&quot;, :datetime
    t.column &quot;updated_at&quot;, :datetime
  end
</pre>
<p>
&#8230;can now be written as:
</p>
<pre>
  create_table :products do |t|
    t.integer :shop_id, :creator_id
    t.string  :name, :value, :default =&gt; &quot;Untitled&quot;
    t.timestamps
  end
</pre>
</li>
<li>Use association name for the wrapper element when using .to_xml. Previous
behavior lead to non-deterministic situations with STI and polymorphic
associations. [Koz, jstrachan]

</li>
<li>Improve performance of calling .create on has_many :through associations.
[evan]

</li>
<li>Improved cloning performance by relying less on exception raising 8159
[Blaine]

</li>
<li>Added ActiveRecord::Base.inspect to return a column-view like #&lt;Post
id:integer, title:string, body:text&gt; [DHH]

</li>
<li>Added yielding of <a href="../../../../classes/Builder.html">Builder</a>
instance for ActiveRecord::Base#to_xml calls [DHH]

</li>
<li>Small additions and fixes for ActiveRecord documentation. Closes 7342
[jeremymcanally]

</li>
<li>Add helpful debugging info to the <a
href="../../../../classes/ActiveRecord/StatementInvalid.html">ActiveRecord::StatementInvalid</a>
exception in
ActiveRecord::ConnectionAdapters::SqliteAdapter#table_structure. Closes
7925. [court3nay]

</li>
<li>SQLite: binary escaping works with $KCODE=&#8217;u&#8217;. 7862 [tsuka]

</li>
<li>Base#to_xml supports serialized attributes. 7502 [jonathan]

</li>
<li>Base.update_all :order and :limit options. Useful for MySQL updates that
must be ordered to avoid violating unique constraints. [Jeremy Kemper]

</li>
<li>Remove deprecated object transactions. People relying on this functionality
should install the object_transactions plugin at <a
href="http://code.bitsweat.net/svn/object_transactions">code.bitsweat.net/svn/object_transactions</a>.
Closes 5637 [Koz, Jeremy Kemper]

</li>
<li>PostgreSQL: remove <a href="../../../../classes/DateTime.html">DateTime</a>
-&gt; Time downcast. Warning: do not enable translate_results for the C
bindings if you have timestamps outside Time&#8216;s domain. [Jeremy
Kemper]

</li>
<li>find_or_create_by_* takes a hash so you can create with more attributes
than are in the method name. For example,
Person.find_or_create_by_name(:name =&gt; &#8216;Henry&#8217;, :comments
=&gt; &#8216;Hi new user!&#8217;) is equivalent to
Person.find_by_name(&#8216;Henry&#8217;) || Person.create(:name =&gt;
&#8216;Henry&#8217;, :comments =&gt; &#8216;Hi new user!&#8217;). 7368
[Josh Susser]

</li>
<li>Make sure with_scope takes both :select and :joins into account when
setting :readonly. Allows you to save records you retrieve using
method_missing on a has_many :through associations. [Koz]

</li>
<li>Allow a polymorphic :source for has_many :through associations. Closes 7143

Ward]

</li>
<li>Added fixtures :all as a way of loading all fixtures in the fixture
directory at once 7214 [manfred]

</li>
<li>Added database connection as a yield parameter to
ActiveRecord::Base.transaction so you can manually rollback [DHH]. Example:

<pre>
  transaction do |transaction|
    david.withdrawal(100)
    mary.deposit(100)
    transaction.rollback! # rolls back the transaction that was otherwise going to be successful
  end
</pre>
</li>
<li>Made increment_counter/decrement_counter play nicely with optimistic
locking, and added a more general update_counters method [Jamis Buck]

</li>
<li>Reworked David&#8216;s query cache to be available as Model.cache
{&#8230;}. For the duration of the block no select query should be run more
then once. Any inserts/deletes/executes will flush the whole cache however
[Tobias Luetke] Task.cache { Task.find(1); Task.find(1) } #=&gt; 1 query

</li>
<li>When dealing with SQLite3, use the table_info pragma helper, so that the

between point releases. [Jamis Buck]

</li>
<li>Oracle: fix lob and text default handling. 7344 [gfriedrich, Michael

</li>
<li>Add AssociationCollection#create! to be consistent with
AssociationCollection#create when dealing with a foreign key that is a

hash and creates the associated record and its association in a
transaction. [Jeremy Kemper]

shadowed by <a
href="../../../../classes/Enumerable.html#M001962">Enumerable#sum</a>.

</li>
<li>Added find_or_initialize_by_X which works like find_or_create_by_X but
doesn&#8216;t save the newly instantiated record. [Sam Stephenson]

</li>
<li>Row locking. Provide a locking clause with the :lock finder option or true
for the default &quot;FOR UPDATE&quot;. Use the lock! method to obtain a
row lock on a single record (reloads the record with :lock =&gt; true).
[Shugo Maeda]

<pre>
  # Obtain an exclusive lock on person 1 so we can safely increment visits.
  Person.transaction do
    # select * from people where id=1 for update
    person = Person.find(1, :lock =&gt; true)
    person.visits += 1
    person.save!
  end
</pre>
</li>
<li>PostgreSQL: introduce allow_concurrency option which determines whether to
use blocking or asynchronous execute. Adapters with blocking execute will
deadlock Ruby threads. The default value is
ActiveRecord::Base.allow_concurrency. [Jeremy Kemper]

</li>
<li>Use a per-thread (rather than global) transaction mutex so you may execute
concurrent transactions on separate connections. [Jeremy Kemper]

</li>
<li>Change AR::Base#to_param to return a String instead of a <a
href="../../../../classes/Fixnum.html">Fixnum</a>. Closes 5320. [Nicholas
Seckar]

</li>
<li>Use explicit delegation instead of method aliasing for AR::Base.to_param
-&gt; AR::Base.id. 5299 (skaes@web.de)

</li>
<li>Refactored ActiveRecord::Base.to_xml to become a delegate for
XmlSerializer, which restores sanity to the mega method. This refactoring
also reinstates the opinions that type=&quot;string&quot; is redundant and
ugly and nil-differentiation is not a concern of serialization [DHH]

</li>
<li>Added simple hash conditions to find that&#8216;ll just convert hash to an
AND-based condition string 5143 [hcatlin@gmail.com]. Example:

<pre>
  Person.find(:all, :conditions =&gt; { :last_name =&gt; &quot;Catlin&quot;, :status =&gt; 1 }, :limit =&gt; 2)
</pre>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
&#8230;is the same as:
</p>
<pre>
    Person.find(:all, :conditions =&gt; [ &quot;last_name = ? and status = ?&quot;, &quot;Catlin&quot;, 1 ], :limit =&gt; 2)

  This makes it easier to pass in the options from a form or otherwise outside.

<li>Allow models to override to_xml. 4989 [Blair Zajac
&lt;blair@orcaware.com&gt;]

used to label the domain socket. 5247 [shimbo@is.naist.jp]

foreign key to the associate&#8216;s primary key and adds it to the correct
association. 5815, 5829 [josh@hasmanythrough.com]

</li>
<li>Add records to has_many :through using &lt;&lt;, push, and concat by
creating the association record. Raise if base or associate are new records
since both ids are required to create the association. build raises since
you can&#8216;t associate an unsaved record. create! takes an attributes
hash and creates the associated record and its association in a
transaction. [Jeremy Kemper]

<pre>
  # Create a tagging to associate the post and tag.
  post.tags &lt;&lt; Tag.find_by_name('old')
  post.tags.create! :name =&gt; 'general'

</li>
<li>Replace Reloadable with Reloadable::Deprecated. [Nicholas Seckar]

</li>
<li>Cache nil results for has_one associations so multiple calls don&#8216;t

<li>Fixed to_xml with :include misbehaviors when invoked on array of model
instances 5690 [alexkwolfe@gmail.com]

</li>
<li>SQLServer: added tests to ensure all database statements are closed,
refactored identity_insert management code to use blocks, removed
update/delete rowcount code out of execute and into update/delete, changed
insert to go through execute method, removed unused quoting methods,
disabled pessimistic locking tests as feature is currently unsupported,

<li>Clearer has_one/belongs_to model names (account has_one :user). 5632
[matt@mattmargolis.net]

<li>Add AssociationCollection#sum since the method_missing invokation has been
shadowed by <a
href="../../../../classes/Enumerable.html#M001962">Enumerable#sum</a>.

</li>
<li>Added find_or_initialize_by_X which works like find_or_create_by_X but
doesn&#8216;t save the newly instantiated record. [Sam Stephenson]

</li>
<li>Row locking. Provide a locking clause with the :lock finder option or true
for the default &quot;FOR UPDATE&quot;. Use the lock! method to obtain a
row lock on a single record (reloads the record with :lock =&gt; true).
[Shugo Maeda]

<pre>
  # Obtain an exclusive lock on person 1 so we can safely increment visits.
  Person.transaction do
    # select * from people where id=1 for update
    person = Person.find(1, :lock =&gt; true)
    person.visits += 1
    person.save!
  end
</pre>
</li>
<li>PostgreSQL: introduce allow_concurrency option which determines whether to
use blocking or asynchronous execute. Adapters with blocking execute will
deadlock Ruby threads. The default value is
ActiveRecord::Base.allow_concurrency. [Jeremy Kemper]

</li>
<li>Use a per-thread (rather than global) transaction mutex so you may execute
concurrent transactions on separate connections. [Jeremy Kemper]

</li>
<li>Change AR::Base#to_param to return a String instead of a <a
href="../../../../classes/Fixnum.html">Fixnum</a>. Closes 5320. [Nicholas
Seckar]

</li>
<li>Use explicit delegation instead of method aliasing for AR::Base.to_param
-&gt; AR::Base.id. 5299 (skaes@web.de)

</li>
<li>Refactored ActiveRecord::Base.to_xml to become a delegate for
XmlSerializer, which restores sanity to the mega method. This refactoring
also reinstates the opinions that type=&quot;string&quot; is redundant and
ugly and nil-differentiation is not a concern of serialization [DHH]

</li>
<li>Added simple hash conditions to find that&#8216;ll just convert hash to an
AND-based condition string 5143 [hcatlin@gmail.com]. Example:

<pre>
  Person.find(:all, :conditions =&gt; { :last_name =&gt; &quot;Catlin&quot;, :status =&gt; 1 }, :limit =&gt; 2)
</pre>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
&#8230;is the same as:
</p>
<pre>
    Person.find(:all, :conditions =&gt; [ &quot;last_name = ? and status = ?&quot;, &quot;Catlin&quot;, 1 ], :limit =&gt; 2)

  This makes it easier to pass in the options from a form or otherwise outside.

<li>Allow models to override to_xml. 4989 [Blair Zajac
&lt;blair@orcaware.com&gt;]

used to label the domain socket. 5247 [shimbo@is.naist.jp]

</li>
<li>Records and arrays of records are bound as quoted ids. [Jeremy Kemper]

<pre>
  Foo.find(:all, :conditions =&gt; ['bar_id IN (?)', bars])
  Foo.find(:first, :conditions =&gt; ['bar_id = ?', bar])

</li>
<li>Allow overriding of find parameters in scoped has_many :through calls [Rick
Olson]

<p>
In this example, :include =&gt; false disables the default eager
association from loading. :select changes the standard select clause.
:joins specifies a join that is added to the end of the has_many :through
query.
</p>
<pre>
  class Post &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
    has_many :tags, :through =&gt; :taggings, :include =&gt; :tagging do
      def add_joins_and_select
        find :all, :select =&gt; 'tags.*, authors.id as author_id', :include =&gt; false,
          :joins =&gt; 'left outer join posts on taggings.taggable_id = posts.id left outer join authors on posts.author_id = authors.id'

<li>Eager Loading support added for has_many :through =&gt; :has_many
associations (see below). [Rick Olson]

</li>
<li>Allow has_many :through to work on has_many associations (closes 3864)

<li>SQL Server adapter gets some love 4298 [rtomayko@gmail.com]

</li>
<li>Added OpenBase database adapter that builds on top of the <a

driver. All functionality except LIMIT/OFFSET is supported 3528
[derrickspell@cdmplus.com]

</li>
<li>Rework table aliasing to account for truncated table aliases. Add smarter
table aliasing when doing eager loading of STI associations. This allows
you to use the association name in the order/where clause. [Jonathan Viney
/ Rick Olson] 4108 Example (SpecialComment is using STI):

<pre>
  Author.find(:all, :include =&gt; { :posts =&gt; :special_comments }, :order =&gt; 'special_comments.body')
</pre>
</li>
<li>Add AbstractAdapter#table_alias_for to create table aliases according to
the rules of the current adapter. [Rick]

</li>
<li>Provide access to the underlying database connection through
Adapter#raw_connection. Enables the use of db-specific methods without
complicating the adapters. 2090 [Koz]

</li>
<li>Remove broken attempts at handling columns with a default of
&#8216;now()&#8217; in the postgresql adapter. 2257 [Koz]

</li>
<li>Added connection#current_database that&#8216;ll return of the current
database (only works in MySQL, SQL Server, and Oracle so far &#8212; please
help implement for the rest of the adapters) 3663 [Tom ward]

</li>
<li>Fixed that Migration#execute would have the table name prefix appended to
its query 4110 [mark.imbriaco@pobox.com]

</li>
<li>Make all tinyint(1) variants act like boolean in mysql (tinyint(1)
unsigned, etc.) [Jamis Buck]

</li>
<li>Use association&#8216;s :conditions when eager loading.
[jeremyevans0@gmail.com] 4144

</li>
<li>Alias the has_and_belongs_to_many join table on eager includes. 4106
[jeremyevans0@gmail.com]

<p>
This statement would normally error because the projects_developers table
is joined twice, and therefore joined_on would be ambiguous.
</p>
<pre>
  Developer.find(:all, :include =&gt; {:projects =&gt; :developers}, :conditions =&gt; 'join_project_developers.joined_on IS NOT NULL')
</pre>
</li>
<li>Oracle adapter gets some love 4230 [schoenm@earthlink.net]

<pre>

  * Fixes an issue with nil numeric length/scales (several)
  * Implements support for XMLTYPE columns [wilig / Kubo Takehiro]
  * Tweaks a unit test to get it all green again
  * Adds support for #current_database
</pre>
</li>
<li>Added Base.abstract_class? that marks which classes are not part of the
Active Record hierarchy 3704 [Rick Olson]

<pre>
  class CachedModel &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
    self.abstract_class = true
  end

  class Post &lt; CachedModel

<pre>
  class Foo &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
    has_many :attachments, :as =&gt; :attachable, :dependent =&gt; :delete_all
  end
</pre>
</li>
<li>Nicer error message on has_many :through when :through reflection can not
be found. 4042 [court3nay@gmail.com]

</li>
<li>Upgrade to Transaction::Simple 1.3 [Jamis Buck]

</li>
<li>Catch FixtureClassNotFound when using instantiated fixtures on a fixture
that has no ActiveRecord model [Rick Olson]

</li>
<li>Dynamically set allow_concurrency. 4044 [Stefan Kaes]

</li>
<li>Added Base#to_xml that&#8216;ll turn the current record into a XML
representation [DHH]. Example:

<pre>
  topic.to_xml

<p>
&#8230;returns:
</p>
<pre>
  &lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot;?&gt;
  &lt;topic&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;The First Topic&lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;author-name&gt;David&lt;/author-name&gt;
    &lt;id type=&quot;integer&quot;&gt;1&lt;/id&gt;
    &lt;approved type=&quot;boolean&quot;&gt;false&lt;/approved&gt;
    &lt;replies-count type=&quot;integer&quot;&gt;0&lt;/replies-count&gt;
    &lt;bonus-time type=&quot;datetime&quot;&gt;2000-01-01 08:28:00&lt;/bonus-time&gt;
    &lt;written-on type=&quot;datetime&quot;&gt;2003-07-16 09:28:00&lt;/written-on&gt;
    &lt;content&gt;Have a nice day&lt;/content&gt;
    &lt;author-email-address&gt;david@loudthinking.com&lt;/author-email-address&gt;
    &lt;parent-id&gt;&lt;/parent-id&gt;
    &lt;last-read type=&quot;date&quot;&gt;2004-04-15&lt;/last-read&gt;
  &lt;/topic&gt;
</pre>
<p>
&#8230;and you can configure with:
</p>
<pre>
  topic.to_xml(:skip_instruct =&gt; true, :except =&gt; [ :id, bonus_time, :written_on, replies_count ])
</pre>
<p>
&#8230;that&#8216;ll return:
</p>
<pre>
  &lt;topic&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;The First Topic&lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;author-name&gt;David&lt;/author-name&gt;
    &lt;approved type=&quot;boolean&quot;&gt;false&lt;/approved&gt;
    &lt;content&gt;Have a nice day&lt;/content&gt;
    &lt;author-email-address&gt;david@loudthinking.com&lt;/author-email-address&gt;
    &lt;parent-id&gt;&lt;/parent-id&gt;
    &lt;last-read type=&quot;date&quot;&gt;2004-04-15&lt;/last-read&gt;
  &lt;/topic&gt;
</pre>
<p>
You can even do load first-level associations as part of the document:
</p>
<pre>
  firm.to_xml :include =&gt; [ :account, :clients ]
</pre>
<p>
&#8230;that&#8216;ll return something like:
</p>
<pre>
  &lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot;?&gt;
  &lt;firm&gt;
    &lt;id type=&quot;integer&quot;&gt;1&lt;/id&gt;
    &lt;rating type=&quot;integer&quot;&gt;1&lt;/rating&gt;
    &lt;name&gt;37signals&lt;/name&gt;
    &lt;clients&gt;
      &lt;client&gt;
        &lt;rating type=&quot;integer&quot;&gt;1&lt;/rating&gt;
        &lt;name&gt;Summit&lt;/name&gt;
      &lt;/client&gt;
      &lt;client&gt;
        &lt;rating type=&quot;integer&quot;&gt;1&lt;/rating&gt;
        &lt;name&gt;Microsoft&lt;/name&gt;

    &lt;/clients&gt;
    &lt;account&gt;
      &lt;id type=&quot;integer&quot;&gt;1&lt;/id&gt;
      &lt;credit-limit type=&quot;integer&quot;&gt;50&lt;/credit-limit&gt;
    &lt;/account&gt;
  &lt;/firm&gt;
</pre>
</li>
<li>Allow :counter_cache to take a column name for custom counter cache columns
[Jamis Buck]

</li>
<li>Documentation fixes for :dependent [robby@planetargon.com]

</li>
<li>Stop the MySQL adapter crashing when views are present. 3782 [Jonathan
Viney]

</li>
<li>Don&#8216;t classify the belongs_to class, it is already singular 4117
[keithm@infused.org]

</li>
<li>Allow set_fixture_class to take Classes instead of strings for a class in a
module. Raise FixtureClassNotFound if a fixture can&#8216;t load. [Rick
Olson]

</li>
<li>Fix quoting of inheritance column for STI eager loading 4098 [Jonathan
Viney &lt;jonathan@bluewire.net.nz&gt;]

</li>
<li>Added smarter table aliasing for eager associations for multiple self joins
3580 [Rick Olson]

<pre>
  * The first time a table is referenced in a join, no alias is used.
  * After that, the parent class name and the reflection name are used.

      Tree.find(:all, :include =&gt; :children) # LEFT OUTER JOIN trees AS tree_children ...

  * Any additional join references get a numerical suffix like '_2', '_3', etc.
</pre>
</li>
<li>Fixed eager loading problems with single-table inheritance 3580 [Rick
Olson]. Post.find(:all, :include =&gt; :special_comments) now returns all
posts, and any special comments that the posts may have. And made STI work
with has_many :through and polymorphic belongs_to.

</li>
<li>Added cascading eager loading that allows for queries like
Author.find(:all, :include=&gt; { :posts=&gt; :comments }), which will
fetch all authors, their posts, and the comments belonging to those posts
in a single query (using LEFT OUTER JOIN) 3913 [anna@wota.jp]. Examples:

<pre>
  # cascaded in two levels
  &gt;&gt; Author.find(:all, :include=&gt;{:posts=&gt;:comments})
  =&gt; authors
       +- posts
            +- comments

  # cascaded in two levels and normal association
  &gt;&gt; Author.find(:all, :include=&gt;[{:posts=&gt;:comments}, :categorizations])
  =&gt; authors
       +- posts
            +- comments
       +- categorizations

  # cascaded in two levels with two has_many associations
  &gt;&gt; Author.find(:all, :include=&gt;{:posts=&gt;[:comments, :categorizations]})
  =&gt; authors
       +- posts
            +- comments
            +- categorizations

  # cascaded in three levels
  &gt;&gt; Company.find(:all, :include=&gt;{:groups=&gt;{:members=&gt;{:favorites}}})
  =&gt; companies
       +- groups
            +- members
                 +- favorites
</pre>
</li>
<li>Make counter cache work when replacing an association 3245
[eugenol@gmail.com]

</li>
<li>Make migrations verbose [Jamis Buck]

</li>
<li>Make counter_cache work with polymorphic belongs_to [Jamis Buck]

</li>
<li>Fixed that calling HasOneProxy#build_model repeatedly would cause saving to
happen 4058 [anna@wota.jp]

</li>
<li>Added Sybase database adapter that relies on the Sybase Open Client
bindings (see <a
href="http://raa.ruby-lang.org/project/sybase-ctlib">raa.ruby-lang.org/project/sybase-ctlib</a>)
3765 [John Sheets]. It&#8216;s almost completely Active Record compliant
(including migrations), but has the following caveats:

<pre>
  * Does not support DATE SQL column types; use DATETIME instead.
  * Date columns on HABTM join tables are returned as String, not Time.
  * Insertions are potentially broken for :polymorphic join tables
  * BLOB column access not yet fully supported
</pre>
</li>
<li>Clear stale, cached connections left behind by defunct threads. [Jeremy
Kemper]

</li>
<li>CHANGED DEFAULT: set ActiveRecord::Base.allow_concurrency to false. Most AR
usage is in single-threaded applications. [Jeremy Kemper]

</li>
<li>Renamed the &quot;oci&quot; adapter to &quot;oracle&quot;, but kept the old
name as an alias 4017 [schoenm@earthlink.net]

</li>
<li>Fixed that Base.save should always return false if the save didn&#8216;t
succeed, including if it has halted by before_save&#8216;s 1861, 2477 [DHH]

</li>
<li>Speed up class -&gt; connection caching and stale connection verification.
3979 [Stefan Kaes]

</li>
<li>Add set_fixture_class to allow the use of table name accessors with models
which use set_table_name. [Kevin Clark]

</li>
<li>Added that fixtures to placed in subdirectories of the main fixture files
are also loaded 3937 [dblack@wobblini.net]

</li>
<li>Define attribute query methods to avoid method_missing calls. 3677
[jonathan@bluewire.net.nz]

*1.13.0* (November 7th, 2005)
</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed faulty regex in get_table_name method (SQLServerAdapter) 2639 [Ryan
Tomayko]

</li>
<li>Added :include as an option for association declarations [DHH]. Example:

<pre>
  has_many :posts, :include =&gt; [ :author, :comments ]
</pre>
</li>
<li>Rename Base.constrain to Base.with_scope so it doesn&#8216;t conflict with
existing concept of database constraints. Make scoping more robust: uniform
method =&gt; parameters, validated method names and supported finder
parameters, raise exception on nested scopes. [Jeremy Kemper] Example:

<pre>
  Comment.with_scope(:find =&gt; { :conditions =&gt; 'active=true' }, :create =&gt; { :post_id =&gt; 5 }) do
    # Find where name = ? and active=true
    Comment.find :all, :conditions =&gt; ['name = ?', name]
    # Create comment associated with :post_id
    Comment.create :body =&gt; &quot;Hello world&quot;
  end
</pre>
</li>
<li>Fixed that SQL Server should ignore :size declarations on anything but
integer and string in the agnostic schema representation 2756 [Ryan
Tomayko]

</li>
<li>Added constrain scoping for creates using a hash of attributes bound to the
:creation key [DHH]. Example:

<pre>
  Comment.constrain(:creation =&gt; { :post_id =&gt; 5 }) do
    # Associated with :post_id
    Comment.create :body =&gt; &quot;Hello world&quot;
  end
</pre>
<p>
This is rarely used directly, but allows for find_or_create on
associations. So you can do:
</p>
<pre>
  # If the tag doesn't exist, a new one is created that's associated with the person
  person.tags.find_or_create_by_name(&quot;Summer&quot;)
</pre>
</li>
<li>Added find_or_create_by_X as a second type of dynamic finder that&#8216;ll
create the record if it doesn&#8216;t already exist [DHH]. Example:

<pre>
  # No 'Summer' tag exists
  Tag.find_or_create_by_name(&quot;Summer&quot;) # equal to Tag.create(:name =&gt; &quot;Summer&quot;)

  # Now the 'Summer' tag does exist
  Tag.find_or_create_by_name(&quot;Summer&quot;) # equal to Tag.find_by_name(&quot;Summer&quot;)
</pre>
</li>
<li>Added extension capabilities to has_many and has_and_belongs_to_many
proxies [DHH]. Example:

<pre>
  class Account &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
    has_many :people do
      def find_or_create_by_name(name)
        first_name, *last_name = name.split
        last_name = last_name.join &quot; &quot;

        find_or_create_by_first_name_and_last_name(first_name, last_name)
      end
    end
  end

  person = Account.find(:first).people.find_or_create_by_name(&quot;David Heinemeier Hansson&quot;)
  person.first_name # =&gt; &quot;David&quot;
  person.last_name  # =&gt; &quot;Heinemeier Hansson&quot;
</pre>
<p>
Note that the anoymous module must be declared using brackets, not do/end
(due to order of evaluation).

<li>Omit internal dtproperties table from SQLServer table list. 2729
[rtomayko@gmail.com]

</li>
<li>Quote column names in generated SQL. 2728 [rtomayko@gmail.com]

</li>
<li>Correct the pure-Ruby MySQL 4.1.1 shim&#8216;s version test. 2718 [Jeremy
Kemper]

</li>
<li>Add Model.create! to match existing model.save! method. When save! raises
RecordInvalid, you can catch the exception, retrieve the invalid record
(invalid_exception.record), and see its errors
(invalid_exception.record.errors). [Jeremy Kemper]

</li>
<li>Correct fixture behavior when table name pluralization is off. 2719 [Rick
Bradley &lt;rick@rickbradley.com&gt;]

</li>
<li>Use AR::Base.silence rather than AR::Base.logger.silence in fixtures to

</li>
<li>Constraints are cloned so they can&#8216;t be inadvertently modified while
they&#8216;re

</li>
</ul>
<p>
in effect. Added :readonly finder constraint. Calling an association
collection&#8216;s class method (Part.foobar via item.parts.foobar)
constrains :readonly =&gt; false since the collection&#8216;s :joins
constraint would otherwise force it to true. [Jeremy Kemper

&lt;robby@planetargon.com&gt;]

</li>
<li>Introduce read-only records. If you call object.readonly! then it will mark
the object as read-only and raise ReadOnlyRecord if you call object.save.
object.readonly? reports whether the object is read-only. Passing :readonly
=&gt; true to any finder method will mark returned records as read-only.
The :joins option now implies :readonly, so if you use this option, saving
the same record will now fail. Use find_by_sql to work around.

</li>
<li>Avoid memleak in dev mode when using fcgi

</li>
<li>Simplified .clear on active record associations by using the existing
delete_records method. 1906 [Caleb &lt;me@cpb.ca&gt;]

<li>Added :force option to create_table that&#8216;ll try to drop the table if
it already exists before creating

</li>
<li>Fix transactions so that calling return while inside a transaction will not
leave an open transaction on the connection. [Nicholas Seckar]

</li>
<li>Use foreign_key inflection uniformly. 2156 [Blair Zajac
&lt;blair@orcaware.com&gt;]

<li>Standardize the interpretation of boolean columns in the Mysql and Sqlite
adapters. (Use MysqlAdapter.emulate_booleans = false to disable this

<pre>
  ActiveRecord::Base.observers = :cacher, :garbage_collector
</pre>

<li>Fix eager loading error messages, allow :include to specify tables using
strings or symbols. Closes 2222 [Marcel Molina]

</li>
<li>Added check for RAILS_CONNECTION_ADAPTERS on startup and only load the

2099 [deberg]

</li>
<li>Fixed that the SQL Server adapter would sometimes return DBI::Timestamp

same model when the cached results were available 1947 [sd@notso.net]

</li>
<li>Added log_level and use_silence parameter to ActiveRecord::Base.benchmark.
The first controls at what level the benchmark statement will be logged
(now as debug, instead of info) and the second that can be passed false to
include all logging statements during the benchmark block/

</li>
<li>Make sure the schema_info table is created before querying the current

[emptysands@gmail.com]

</li>
<li>Fix create_table so that id column is implicitly added [Rick Olson]

</li>
<li>Default sequence names for Oracle changed to #{table_name}_seq, which is
the most commonly used standard. In addition, a new method
ActiveRecord::Base#set_sequence_name allows the developer to set the
sequence name per model. This is a non-backwards-compatible change &#8212;
anyone using the old-style &quot;rails_sequence&quot; will need to either
create new sequences, or set: ActiveRecord::Base.set_sequence_name =
&quot;rails_sequence&quot; 1798

</li>
<li>OCIAdapter now properly handles synonyms, which are commonly used to
separate out the schema owner from the application user 1798

</li>
<li>Fixed the handling of camelCase columns names in Oracle 1798

</li>
<li>Implemented for OCI the Rakefile tasks of :clone_structure_to_test,
:db_structure_dump, and :purge_test_database, which enable Oracle folks to
enjoy all the agile goodness of <a
href="../../../../classes/Rails.html">Rails</a> for testing. Note that the
current implementation is fairly limited &#8212; only tables and sequences
are cloned, not constraints or indexes. A full clone in Oracle generally
requires some manual effort, and is version-specific. Post 9i, Oracle
recommends the use of the DBMS_METADATA package, though that approach
requires editing of the physical characteristics generated 1798

</li>
<li>Fixed the handling of multiple blob columns in Oracle if one or more of
them are null 1798

</li>
<li>Added support for calling constrained class methods on has_many and
has_and_belongs_to_many collections 1764 [Tobias Luetke]

<pre>
  class Comment &lt; AR:B
    def self.search(q)
      find(:all, :conditions =&gt; [&quot;body = ?&quot;, q])
    end
  end

  class Post &lt; AR:B
    has_many :comments
  end

  Post.find(1).comments.search('hi') # =&gt; SELECT * from comments WHERE post_id = 1 AND body = 'hi'
</pre>
<p>
NOTICE: This patch changes the underlying SQL generated by
has_and_belongs_to_many queries. If your relying on that, such as by
explicitly referencing the old t and j aliases, you&#8216;ll need to update
your code. Of course, you _shouldn&#8216;t_ be relying on details like that
no less than you should be diving in to touch private variables. But just
in case you do, consider yourself noticed :)
</p>
</li>
<li>Added migration support for SQLite (using temporary tables to simulate
ALTER TABLE) 1771 [Sam Stephenson]

</li>
<li>Remove extra definition of supports_migrations? from abstract_adaptor.rb
[Nicholas Seckar]

</li>
<li>Fix acts_as_list so that moving next-to-last item to the bottom does not
result in duplicate item positions

</li>
<li>Fixed incompatibility in DB2 adapter with the new limit/offset approach
1718 [Maik Schmidt]

</li>
<li>Added :select option to find which can specify a different value than the
default *, like find(:all, :select =&gt; &quot;first_name,
last_name&quot;), if you either only want to select part of the columns or
exclude columns otherwise included from a join 1338 [Stefan Kaes]

</li>
</ul>
<p>
*1.11.1* (11 July, 2005)
</p>
<ul>
<li>Added support for limit and offset with eager loading of has_one and
belongs_to associations. Using the options with has_many and
has_and_belongs_to_many associations will now raise an <a
href="../../../../classes/ActiveRecord/ConfigurationError.html">ActiveRecord::ConfigurationError</a>
1692 [Rick Olsen]

</li>
<li>Fixed that assume_bottom_position (in acts_as_list) could be called on
items already last in the list and they would move one position away from
the list 1648 [tyler@kianta.com]

</li>
<li>Added ActiveRecord::Base.threaded_connections flag to turn off 1-connection
per thread (required for thread safety). By default it&#8216;s on, but
WEBrick in <a href="../../../../classes/Rails.html">Rails</a> need it off

[courtenay]

</li>
<li>Fixed first run of &quot;rake migrate&quot; on PostgreSQL by not expecting
a return value on the id 1640

</li>
</ul>
<p>
*1.11.0* (6 July, 2005)
</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed that Yaml error message in fixtures hid the real error 1623 [Nicholas
Seckar]

</li>
<li>Changed logging of SQL statements to use the DEBUG level instead of INFO

</li>
<li>Added new Migrations framework for describing schema transformations in a
way that can be easily applied across multiple databases 1604 [Tobias
Luetke] See documentation under <a
href="../../../../classes/ActiveRecord/Migration.html">ActiveRecord::Migration</a>
and the additional support in the <a
href="../../../../classes/Rails.html">Rails</a> rakefile/generator.

</li>
<li>Added callback hooks to association collections 1549 [Florian Weber].
Example:

<pre>
  class Project
    has_and_belongs_to_many :developers, :before_add =&gt; :evaluate_velocity

    def evaluate_velocity(developer)
      ...
    end
  end
</pre>
<p>
..raising an exception will cause the object not to be added (or removed,
with before_remove).
</p>
</li>
<li>Fixed Base.content_columns call for SQL Server adapter 1450 [DeLynn Berry]

</li>
<li>Fixed Base#write_attribute to work with both symbols and strings 1190 [Paul
Legato]

</li>
<li>Fixed that has_and_belongs_to_many didn&#8216;t respect single table
inheritance types 1081 [Florian Weber]

</li>
<li>Speed up ActiveRecord#method_missing for the common case (read_attribute).

</li>
<li>Only notify observers on after_find and after_initialize if these methods
are defined on the model. 1235 [skaes@web.de]

</li>
<li>Fixed that single-table inheritance sub-classes couldn&#8216;t be used to
limit the result set with eager loading 1215 [Chris McGrath]

</li>
<li>Fixed validates_numericality_of to work with overrided getter-method when
:allow_nil is on 1316 [raidel@onemail.at]

</li>
<li>Added roots, root, and siblings to the batch of methods added by
acts_as_tree 1541 [michael@schuerig.de]

</li>
<li>Added support for limit/offset with the MS SQL Server driver so that
pagination will now work 1569 [DeLynn Berry]

</li>
<li>Added support for ODBC connections to MS SQL Server so you can connect from
a non-Windows machine 1569 [Mark Imbriaco/DeLynn Berry]

</li>
<li>Fixed that multiparameter posts ignored attr_protected 1532
[alec+rails@veryclever.net]

</li>
<li>Fixed problem with eager loading when using a has_and_belongs_to_many
association using :association_foreign_key 1504
[flash@vanklinkenbergsoftware.nl]

</li>
<li>Fixed Base#find to honor the documentation on how :joins work and make them
consistent with Base#count 1405 [pritchie@gmail.com]. What used to be:

<pre>
  Developer.find :all, :joins =&gt; 'developers_projects', :conditions =&gt; 'id=developer_id AND project_id=1'
</pre>
<p>
&#8230;should instead be:
</p>
<pre>
  Developer.find(
    :all,
    :joins =&gt; 'LEFT JOIN developers_projects ON developers.id = developers_projects.developer_id',
    :conditions =&gt; 'project_id=1'
  )
</pre>
</li>
<li>Fixed that validations didn&#8216;t respecting custom setting for
too_short, too_long messages 1437 [Marcel Molina]

</li>
<li>Fixed that clear_association_cache doesn&#8216;t delete new associations on
new records (so you can safely place new records in the session with Action
Pack without having new associations wiped) 1494 [cluon]

</li>
<li>Fixed that calling Model.find([]) returns [] and doesn&#8216;t throw an
exception 1379

</li>
<li>Fixed that adding a record to a has_and_belongs_to collection would always
save it &#8212; now it only saves if its a new record 1203 [Alisdair
McDiarmid]

</li>
<li>Fixed saving of in-memory association structures to happen as a
after_create/after_update callback instead of after_save &#8212; that way
you can add new associations in after_create/after_update callbacks without
getting them saved twice

</li>
<li>Allow any <a href="../../../../classes/Enumerable.html">Enumerable</a>, not
just Array, to work as bind variables 1344 [Jeremy Kemper]

</li>
<li>Added actual database-changing behavior to collection assigment for
has_many and has_and_belongs_to_many 1425 [Sebastian Kanthak]. Example:

<pre>
  david.projects = [Project.find(1), Project.new(&quot;name&quot; =&gt; &quot;ActionWebSearch&quot;)]
  david.save
</pre>
<p>
If david.projects already contain the project with ID 1, this is left
unchanged. Any other projects are dropped. And the new project is saved
when david.save is called.
</p>
<p>
Also included is a way to do assignments through IDs, which is perfect for
checkbox updating, so you get to do:
</p>
<pre>
  david.project_ids = [1, 5, 7]
</pre>
</li>
<li>Corrected typo in find SQL for has_and_belongs_to_many. 1312
[ben@bensinclair.com]

</li>
<li>Fixed sanitized conditions for has_many finder method. 1281
[jackc@hylesanderson.com, pragdave, Tobias Luetke]

</li>
<li>Comprehensive PostgreSQL schema support. Use the optional
schema_search_path directive in database.yml to give a comma-separated list
of schemas to search for your tables. This allows you, for example, to have
tables in a shared schema without having to use a custom table name. See <a
href="http://www.postgresql.org/docs/8.0/interactive/ddl-schemas.html">www.postgresql.org/docs/8.0/interactive/ddl-schemas.html</a>
to learn more. 827 [dave@cherryville.org]

</li>
<li>Corrected @@configurations typo 1410 [david@ruppconsulting.com]

</li>
<li>Return PostgreSQL columns in the order they were declared 1374
[perlguy@gmail.com]

</li>
<li>Allow before/after update hooks to work on models using optimistic locking

</li>
<li>Eager loading of dependent has_one associations won&#8216;t delete the
association 1212

</li>
<li>Added a second parameter to the build and create method for has_one that
controls whether the existing association should be replaced (which means
nullifying its foreign key as well). By default this is true, but false can
be passed to prevent it.

</li>
<li>Using transactional fixtures now causes the data to be loaded only once.

</li>
<li>Added fixture accessor methods that can be used when instantiated fixtures
are disabled.

<pre>
  fixtures :web_sites

  def test_something
    assert_equal &quot;Ruby on Rails&quot;, web_sites(:rubyonrails).name
  end
</pre>
</li>
<li>Added DoubleRenderError exception that&#8216;ll be raised if render* is
called twice 518 [Nicholas Seckar]

</li>
<li>Fixed exceptions occuring after render has been called 1096 [Nicholas
Seckar]

</li>
<li>CHANGED: validates_presence_of now uses Errors#add_on_blank, which will
make &quot; &quot; fail the validation where it didn&#8216;t before 1309

</li>
<li>Added Errors#add_on_blank which works like Errors#add_on_empty, but uses
Object#blank? instead

</li>
<li>Added the :if option to all validations that can either use a block or a
method pointer to determine whether the validation should be run or not.
1324 [Duane Johnson/jhosteny]. Examples:

<p>
Conditional validations such as the following are made possible:
</p>
<pre>
  validates_numericality_of :income, :if =&gt; :employed?
</pre>
<p>
Conditional validations can also solve the salted login generator problem:
</p>
<pre>
  validates_confirmation_of :password, :if =&gt; :new_password?
</pre>
<p>
Using blocks:
</p>
<pre>
  validates_presence_of :username, :if =&gt; Proc.new { |user| user.signup_step &gt; 1 }
</pre>
</li>
<li>Fixed use of construct_finder_sql when using :join 1288 [dwlt@dwlt.net]

</li>
<li>Fixed that :delete_sql in has_and_belongs_to_many associations
couldn&#8216;t access record properties 1299 [Rick Olson]

</li>
<li>Fixed that clone would break when an aggregate had the same name as one of
its attributes 1307 [Jeremy Kemper]

</li>
<li>Changed that destroying an object will only freeze the attributes hash,
which keeps the object from having attributes changed (as that
wouldn&#8216;t make sense), but allows for the querying of associations
after it has been destroyed.

</li>
<li>Changed the callbacks such that observers are notified before the in-object
callbacks are triggered. Without this change, it wasn&#8216;t possible to
act on the whole object in something like a before_destroy observer without
having the objects own callbacks (like deleting associations) called first.

</li>
<li>Added option for passing an array to the find_all version of the dynamic
finders and have it evaluated as an IN fragment. Example:

<pre>
  # SELECT * FROM topics WHERE title IN ('First', 'Second')
  Topic.find_all_by_title([&quot;First&quot;, &quot;Second&quot;])
</pre>
</li>
<li>Added compatibility with camelCase column names for dynamic finders 533
[Dee.Zsombor]

</li>
<li>Fixed extraneous comma in count() function that made it not work with joins
1156 [jarkko/Dee.Zsombor]

</li>
<li>Fixed incompatibility with Base#find with an array of ids that would fail
when using eager loading 1186 [Alisdair McDiarmid]

</li>
<li>Fixed that validate_length_of lost :on option when :within was specified
1195 [jhosteny@mac.com]

</li>
<li>Added encoding and min_messages options for PostgreSQL 1205 [shugo].
Configuration example:

<pre>
  development:
    adapter: postgresql
    database: rails_development
    host: localhost
    username: postgres
    password:
    encoding: UTF8
    min_messages: ERROR
</pre>
</li>
<li>Fixed acts_as_list where deleting an item that was removed from the list
would ruin the positioning of other list items 1197 [Jamis Buck]

</li>
<li>Added validates_exclusion_of as a negative of validates_inclusion_of

</li>
<li>Optimized counting of has_many associations by setting the association to
empty if the count is 0 so repeated calls doesn&#8216;t trigger database
calls

</li>
</ul>
<p>
*1.10.1* (20th April, 2005)
</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed frivilous database queries being triggered with eager loading on
empty associations and other things

</li>
<li>Fixed order of loading in eager associations

</li>
<li>Fixed stray comma when using eager loading and ordering together from
has_many associations 1143

</li>
</ul>
<p>
*1.10.0* (19th April, 2005)
</p>
<ul>
<li>Added eager loading of associations as a way to solve the N+1 problem more
gracefully without piggy-back queries. Example:

<pre>
  for post in Post.find(:all, :limit =&gt; 100)
    puts &quot;Post:            &quot; + post.title
    puts &quot;Written by:      &quot; + post.author.name
    puts &quot;Last comment on: &quot; + post.comments.first.created_on
  end
</pre>
<p>
This used to generate 301 database queries if all 100 posts had both author
and comments. It can now be written as:
</p>
<pre>
  for post in Post.find(:all, :limit =&gt; 100, :include =&gt; [ :author, :comments ])
</pre>
<p>
&#8230;and the number of database queries needed is now 1.
</p>
</li>
<li>Added new unified Base.find API and deprecated the use of find_first and
find_all. See the documentation for Base.find. Examples:

<pre>
  Person.find(1, :conditions =&gt; &quot;administrator = 1&quot;, :order =&gt; &quot;created_on DESC&quot;)
  Person.find(1, 5, 6, :conditions =&gt; &quot;administrator = 1&quot;, :order =&gt; &quot;created_on DESC&quot;)
  Person.find(:first, :order =&gt; &quot;created_on DESC&quot;, :offset =&gt; 5)
  Person.find(:all, :conditions =&gt; [ &quot;category IN (?)&quot;, categories], :limit =&gt; 50)
  Person.find(:all, :offset =&gt; 10, :limit =&gt; 10)
</pre>
</li>
<li>Added acts_as_nested_set 1000 [wschenk]. Introduction:

<pre>
  This acts provides Nested Set functionality.  Nested Set is similiar to Tree, but with
  the added feature that you can select the children and all of it's descendants with
  a single query.  A good use case for this is a threaded post system, where you want
  to display every reply to a comment without multiple selects.
</pre>
</li>
<li>Added Base.save! that attempts to save the record just like Base.save but
will raise a RecordInvalid exception instead of returning false if the
record is not valid [After much pestering from Dave Thomas]

</li>
<li>Fixed PostgreSQL usage of fixtures with regards to public schemas and table
names with dots 962 [gnuman1@gmail.com]

</li>
<li>Fixed that fixtures were being deleted in the same order as inserts causing
FK errors 890 [andrew.john.peters@gmail.com]

</li>
<li>Fixed loading of fixtures in to be in the right order (or PostgreSQL would
bark) 1047 [stephenh@chase3000.com]

</li>
<li>Fixed page caching for non-vhost applications living underneath the root
1004 [Ben Schumacher]

</li>
<li>Fixes a problem with the SQL Adapter which was resulting in IDENTITY_INSERT
not being set to ON when it should be 1104 [adelle]

</li>
<li>Added the option to specify the acceptance string in
validates_acceptance_of 1106 [caleb@aei-tech.com]

</li>
<li>Added insert_at(position) to acts_as_list 1083 [DeLynnB]

</li>
<li>Removed the default order by id on has_and_belongs_to_many queries as it
could kill performance on large sets (you can still specify by hand with
:order)

</li>
<li>Fixed that Base.silence should restore the old logger level when done, not
just set it to DEBUG 1084 [yon@milliped.com]

</li>
<li>Fixed boolean saving on Oracle 1093 [mparrish@pearware.org]

</li>
<li>Moved build_association and create_association for has_one and belongs_to
out of deprecation as they work when the association is nil unlike
association.build and association.create, which require the association to
be already in place 864

</li>
<li>Added rollbacks of transactions if they&#8216;re active as the dispatcher
is killed gracefully (TERM signal) 1054 [Leon Bredt]

</li>
<li>Added quoting of column names for fixtures 997 [jcfischer@gmail.com]

</li>
<li>Fixed counter_sql when no records exist in database for PostgreSQL (would
give error, not 0) 1039 [Caleb Tennis]

</li>
<li>Fixed that benchmarking times for rendering included db runtimes 987
[skaes@web.de]

</li>
<li>Fixed boolean queries for t/f fields in PostgreSQL 995
[dave@cherryville.org]

</li>
<li>Added that model.items.delete(child) will delete the child, not just set
the foreign key to nil, if the child is dependent on the model 978 [Jeremy
Kemper]

</li>
<li>Fixed auto-stamping of dates (created_on/updated_on) for PostgreSQL 985
[dave@cherryville.org]

</li>
<li>Fixed Base.silence/benchmark to only log if a logger has been configured
986 [skaes@web.de]

</li>
<li>Added a join parameter as the third argument to Base.find_first and as the
second to Base.count 426, 988 [skaes@web.de]

</li>
<li>Fixed bug in Base#hash method that would treat records with the same
string-based id as different [Dave Thomas]

</li>
<li>Renamed DateHelper#distance_of_time_in_words_to_now to
DateHelper#time_ago_in_words (old method name is still available as a
deprecated alias)

</li>
</ul>
<p>
*1.9.1* (27th March, 2005)
</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed that Active Record objects with float attribute could not be cloned
808

</li>
<li>Fixed that MissingSourceFile&#8216;s wasn&#8216;t properly detected in
production mode 925 [Nicholas Seckar]

</li>
<li>Fixed that :counter_cache option would look for a line_items_count column
for a LineItem object instead of lineitems_count

</li>
<li>Fixed that AR exists?() would explode on postgresql if the passed id did
not match the PK type 900 [Scott Barron]

</li>
<li>Fixed the MS SQL adapter to work with the new limit/offset approach and
with binary data (still suffering from 7KB limit, though) 901 [delynnb]

</li>
</ul>
<p>
*1.9.0* (22th March, 2005)
</p>
<ul>
<li>Added adapter independent limit clause as a two-element array with the
first being the limit, the second being the offset 795 [Sam Stephenson].
Example:

<pre>
  Developer.find_all nil, 'id ASC', 5      # return the first five developers
  Developer.find_all nil, 'id ASC', [3, 8] # return three developers, starting from #8 and forward
</pre>
<p>
This doesn&#8216;t yet work with the DB2 or MS SQL adapters. Patches to
make that happen are encouraged.
</p>
</li>
<li>Added alias_method :to_param, :id to Base, such that Active Record objects
to be used as URL parameters in Action Pack automatically 812 [Nicholas
Seckar/Sam Stephenson]

</li>
<li>Improved the performance of the OCI8 adapter for Oracle 723 [pilx/gjenkins]

</li>
<li>Added type conversion before saving a record, so string-based values like
&quot;10.0&quot; aren&#8216;t left for the database to convert 820
[dave@cherryville.org]

</li>
<li>Added with additional settings for working with transactional fixtures and
pre-loaded test databases 865 [mindel]

</li>
<li>Fixed acts_as_list to trigger remove_from_list on destroy after the fact,
not before, so a unique position can be maintained 871 [Alisdair McDiarmid]

</li>
<li>Added the possibility of specifying fixtures in multiple calls 816
[kim@tinker.com]

</li>
<li>Added Base.exists?(id) that&#8216;ll return true if an object of the class
with the given id exists 854 [stian@grytoyr.net]

</li>
<li>Added optionally allow for nil or empty strings with
validates_numericality_of 801 [Sebastian Kanthak]

</li>
<li>Fixed problem with using slashes in validates_format_of regular expressions
801 [Sebastian Kanthak]

</li>
<li>Fixed that SQLite3 exceptions are caught and reported properly 823 [yerejm]

</li>
<li>Added that all types of after_find/after_initialized callbacks are
triggered if the explicit implementation is present, not only the explicit
implementation itself

</li>
<li>Fixed that symbols can be used on attribute assignment, like
page.emails.create(:subject =&gt; data.subject, :body =&gt; data.body)

</li>
</ul>
<p>
*1.8.0* (7th March, 2005)
</p>
<ul>
<li>Added ActiveRecord::Base.colorize_logging to control whether to use colors
in logs or not (on by default)

</li>
<li>Added support for timestamp with time zone in PostgreSQL 560 [Scott Barron]

</li>
<li>Added MultiparameterAssignmentErrors and AttributeAssignmentError
exceptions 777 [demetrius]. Documentation:

<pre>
 * +MultiparameterAssignmentErrors+ -- collection of errors that occurred during a mass assignment using the
   +attributes=+ method. The +errors+ property of this exception contains an array of +AttributeAssignmentError+
   objects that should be inspected to determine which attributes triggered the errors.
 * +AttributeAssignmentError+ -- an error occurred while doing a mass assignment through the +attributes=+ method.
   You can inspect the +attribute+ property of the exception object to determine which attribute triggered the error.
</pre>
</li>
<li>Fixed that postgresql adapter would fails when reading bytea fields with
null value 771 [rodrigo k]

</li>
<li>Added transactional fixtures that uses rollback to undo changes to fixtures
instead of DELETE/INSERT &#8212; it&#8216;s much faster. See documentation
under <a href="../../../../classes/Fixtures.html">Fixtures</a> 760 [Jeremy
Kemper]

</li>
<li>Added destruction of dependent objects in has_one associations when a new
assignment happens 742 [mindel]. Example:

<pre>
  class Account &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
    has_one :credit_card, :dependent =&gt; true
  end
  class CreditCard &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
    belongs_to :account
  end

  account.credit_card # =&gt; returns existing credit card, lets say id = 12
  account.credit_card = CreditCard.create(&quot;number&quot; =&gt; &quot;123&quot;)
  account.save # =&gt; CC with id = 12 is destroyed
</pre>
</li>
<li>Added validates_numericality_of 716 [skanthak/c.r.mcgrath]. Docuemntation:

<pre>
  Validates whether the value of the specified attribute is numeric by trying to convert it to
  a float with Kernel.Float (if &lt;tt&gt;integer&lt;/tt&gt; is false) or applying it to the regular expression
  &lt;tt&gt;/^[\+\-]?\d+$/&lt;/tt&gt; (if &lt;tt&gt;integer&lt;/tt&gt; is set to true).

    class Person &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
      validates_numericality_of :value, :on =&gt; :create
    end

  Configuration options:
  * &lt;tt&gt;message&lt;/tt&gt; - A custom error message (default is: &quot;is not a number&quot;)
  * &lt;tt&gt;on&lt;/tt&gt; Specifies when this validation is active (default is :save, other options :create, :update)
  * &lt;tt&gt;only_integer&lt;/tt&gt; Specifies whether the value has to be an integer, e.g. an integral value (default is false)
</pre>
</li>
<li>Fixed that HasManyAssociation#count was using :finder_sql rather than
:counter_sql if it was available 445 [Scott Barron]

</li>
<li>Added better defaults for composed_of, so statements like composed_of
:time_zone, :mapping =&gt; %w( time_zone time_zone ) can be written without
the mapping part (it&#8216;s now assumed)

</li>
<li>Added MacroReflection#macro which will return a symbol describing the macro
used (like :composed_of or :has_many) 718, 248 [james@slashetc.com]

</li>
</ul>
<p>
*1.7.0* (24th February, 2005)
</p>
<ul>
<li>Changed the auto-timestamping feature to use
ActiveRecord::Base.default_timezone instead of entertaining the parallel
ActiveRecord::Base.timestamps_gmt method. The latter is now deprecated and
will throw a warning on use (but still work) 710 [Jamis Buck]

</li>
<li>Added a OCI8-based Oracle adapter that has been verified to work with
Oracle 8 and 9 629 [Graham Jenkins]. Usage notes:

<pre>
  1.  Key generation uses a sequence &quot;rails_sequence&quot; for all tables. (I couldn't find a simple
      and safe way of passing table-specific sequence information to the adapter.)
  2.  Oracle uses DATE or TIMESTAMP datatypes for both dates and times. Consequently I have had to
      resort to some hacks to get data converted to Date or Time in Ruby.
      If the column_name ends in _at (like created_at, updated_at) it's created as a Ruby Time. Else if the
      hours/minutes/seconds are 0, I make it a Ruby Date. Else it's a Ruby Time.
      This is nasty - but if you use Duck Typing you'll probably not care very much.
      In 9i it's tempting to map DATE to Date and TIMESTAMP to Time but I don't think that is
      valid - too many databases use DATE for both.
      Timezones and sub-second precision on timestamps are not supported.
  3.  Default values that are functions (such as &quot;SYSDATE&quot;) are not supported. This is a
      restriction of the way active record supports default values.
  4.  Referential integrity constraints are not fully supported. Under at least
      some circumstances, active record appears to delete parent and child records out of
      sequence and out of transaction scope. (Or this may just be a problem of test setup.)
</pre>
<p>
The OCI8 driver can be retrieved from <a
href="http://rubyforge.org/projects/ruby-oci8">rubyforge.org/projects/ruby-oci8</a>/
</p>
</li>
<li>Added option :schema_order to the PostgreSQL adapter to support the use of
multiple schemas per database 697 [YuriSchimke]

</li>
<li>Optimized the SQL used to generate has_and_belongs_to_many queries by
listing the join table first 693 [yerejm]

</li>
<li>Fixed that when using validation macros with a custom message, if you
happened to use single quotes in the message string you would get a parsing
error 657 [tonka]

</li>
<li>Fixed that Active Record would throw Broken Pipe errors with FCGI when the
MySQL connection timed out instead of reconnecting 428 [Nicholas Seckar]

</li>
<li>Added options to specify an SSL connection for MySQL. Define the following
attributes in the connection config (config/database.yml in <a
href="../../../../classes/Rails.html">Rails</a>) to use it: sslkey,
sslcert, sslca, sslcapath, sslcipher. To use SSL with no client certs, just
set :sslca = &#8217;/dev/null&#8217;. <a
href="http://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql/en/secure-connections.html">dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql/en/secure-connections.html</a>
604 [daniel@nightrunner.com]

</li>
<li>Added automatic dropping/creating of test tables for running the unit tests
on all databases 587 [adelle@bullet.net.au]

</li>
<li>Fixed that find_by_* would fail when column names had numbers 670
[demetrius]

</li>
<li>Fixed the SQL Server adapter on a bunch of issues 667 [DeLynn]

<pre>
  1. Created a new columns method that is much cleaner.
  2. Corrected a problem with the select and select_all methods
     that didn't account for the LIMIT clause being passed into raw SQL statements.
  3. Implemented the string_to_time method in order to create proper instances of the time class.
  4. Added logic to the simplified_type method that allows the database to specify the scale of float data.
  5. Adjusted the quote_column_name to account for the fact that MS SQL is bothered by a forward slash in the data string.
</pre>
</li>
<li>Fixed that the dynamic finder like find_all_by_something_boolean(false)
didn&#8216;t work 649 [lmarlow@yahoo.com]

</li>
<li>Added validates_each that validates each specified attribute against a
block 610 [Jeremy Kemper]. Example:

<pre>
  class Person &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
    validates_each :first_name, :last_name do |record, attr|
      record.errors.add attr, 'starts with z.' if attr[0] == ?z
    end
  end
</pre>
</li>
<li>Added :allow_nil as an explicit option for validates_length_of, so unless
that&#8216;s set to true having the attribute as nil will also return an
error if a range is specified as :within 610 [Jeremy Kemper]

</li>
<li>Added that validates_* now accept blocks to perform validations 618 [Tim
Bates]. Example:

<pre>
  class Person &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
    validate { |person| person.errors.add(&quot;title&quot;, &quot;will never be valid&quot;) if SHOULD_NEVER_BE_VALID }
  end
</pre>
</li>
<li>Addded validation for validate all the associated objects before declaring
failure with validates_associated 618 [Tim Bates]

</li>
<li>Added keyword-style approach to defining the custom relational bindings 545
[Jamis Buck]. Example:

<pre>
  class Project &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
    primary_key &quot;sysid&quot;
    table_name &quot;XYZ_PROJECT&quot;
    inheritance_column { original_inheritance_column + &quot;_id&quot; }
  end
</pre>
</li>
<li>Fixed Base#clone for use with PostgreSQL 565 [hanson@surgery.wisc.edu]

</li>
</ul>
<p>
*1.6.0* (January 25th, 2005)
</p>
<ul>
<li>Added that has_many association build and create methods can take arrays of
record data like Base#create and Base#build to build/create multiple
records at once.

</li>
<li>Added that Base#delete and Base#destroy both can take an array of ids to
delete/destroy 336

</li>
<li>Added the option of supplying an array of attributes to Base#create, so
that multiple records can be created at once.

</li>
<li>Added the option of supplying an array of ids and attributes to
Base#update, so that multiple records can be updated at once (inspired by
526/Duane Johnson). Example

<pre>
  people = { 1 =&gt; { &quot;first_name&quot; =&gt; &quot;David&quot; }, 2 =&gt; { &quot;first_name&quot; =&gt; &quot;Jeremy&quot;} }
  Person.update(people.keys, people.values)
</pre>
</li>
<li>Added ActiveRecord::Base.timestamps_gmt that can be set to true to make the
automated timestamping use GMT instead of local time 520 [Scott Baron]

</li>
<li>Added that update_all calls sanitize_sql on its updates argument, so stuff
like MyRecord.update_all([&#8216;time = ?&#8217;, Time.now]) works 519
[notahat]

</li>
<li>Fixed that the dynamic finders didn&#8216;t treat nil as a &quot;IS
NULL&quot; but rather &quot;= NULL&quot; case 515 [Demetrius]

</li>
<li>Added bind-named arrays for interpolating a group of ids or strings in
conditions 528 [Jeremy Kemper]

</li>
<li>Added that has_and_belongs_to_many associations with additional attributes
also can be created between unsaved objects and only committed to the
database when Base#save is called on the associator 524 [Eric Anderson]

</li>
<li>Fixed that records fetched with piggy-back attributes or through rich
has_and_belongs_to_many associations couldn&#8216;t be saved due to the
extra attributes not part of the table 522 [Eric Anderson]

</li>
<li>Added mass-assignment protection for the inheritance column &#8212;
regardless of a custom column is used or not

</li>
<li>Fixed that association proxies would fail === tests like
PremiumSubscription === @account.subscription

</li>
<li>Fixed that column aliases didn&#8216;t work as expected with the new
MySql411 driver 507 [Demetrius]

</li>
<li>Fixed that find_all would produce invalid sql when called sequentialy 490
[Scott Baron]

</li>
</ul>
<p>
*1.5.1* (January 18th, 2005)
</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed that the belongs_to and has_one proxy would fail a test like
&#8216;if project.manager&#8217; &#8212; this unfortunately also means that
you can&#8216;t call methods like project.manager.build unless there
already is a manager on the project 492 [Tim Bates]

</li>
<li>Fixed that the Ruby/MySQL adapter wouldn&#8216;t connect if the password
was empty 503 [Pelle]

</li>
</ul>
<p>
*1.5.0* (January 17th, 2005)
</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed that unit tests for MySQL are now run as the &quot;rails&quot; user
instead of root 455 [Eric Hodel]

</li>
<li>Added validates_associated that enables validation of objects in an unsaved
association 398 [Tim Bates]. Example:

<pre>
  class Book &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
    has_many :pages
    belongs_to :library

    validates_associated :pages, :library
  end
</pre>
</li>
<li>Added support for associating unsaved objects 402 [Tim Bates]. Rules that
govern this addition:

<pre>
  == Unsaved objects and associations

  You can manipulate objects and associations before they are saved to the database, but there is some special behaviour you should be
  aware of, mostly involving the saving of associated objects.

  === One-to-one associations

  * Assigning an object to a has_one association automatically saves that object, and the object being replaced (if there is one), in
    order to update their primary keys - except if the parent object is unsaved (new_record? == true).
  * If either of these saves fail (due to one of the objects being invalid) the assignment statement returns false and the assignment
    is cancelled.
  * If you wish to assign an object to a has_one association without saving it, use the #association.build method (documented below).
  * Assigning an object to a belongs_to association does not save the object, since the foreign key field belongs on the parent. It does
    not save the parent either.

  === Collections

  * Adding an object to a collection (has_many or has_and_belongs_to_many) automatically saves that object, except if the parent object
    (the owner of the collection) is not yet stored in the database.
  * If saving any of the objects being added to a collection (via #push or similar) fails, then #push returns false.
  * You can add an object to a collection without automatically saving it by using the #collection.build method (documented below).
  * All unsaved (new_record? == true) members of the collection are automatically saved when the parent is saved.
</pre>
</li>
<li>Added replace to associations, so you can do
project.manager.replace(new_manager) or
project.milestones.replace(new_milestones) 402 [Tim Bates]

</li>
<li>Added build and create methods to has_one and belongs_to associations, so
you can now do project.manager.build(attributes) 402 [Tim Bates]

</li>
<li>Added that if a before_* callback returns false, all the later callbacks
and the associated action are cancelled. If an after_* callback returns
false, all the later callbacks are cancelled. Callbacks are generally run
in the order they are defined, with the exception of callbacks defined as
methods on the model, which are called last. 402 [Tim Bates]

</li>
<li>Fixed that Base#== wouldn&#8216;t work for multiple references to the same
unsaved object 402 [Tim Bates]

</li>
<li>Fixed binary support for PostgreSQL 444 [alex@byzantine.no]

</li>
<li>Added a differenciation between AssociationCollection#size and -length. Now
AssociationCollection#size returns the size of the collection by executing
a SELECT COUNT(*) query if the collection hasn&#8216;t been loaded and
calling collection.size if it has. If it&#8216;s more likely than not that
the collection does have a size larger than zero and you need to fetch that
collection afterwards, it&#8216;ll take one less SELECT query if you use
length.

</li>
<li>Added Base#attributes that returns a hash of all the attributes with their
names as keys and clones of their objects as values 433 [atyp.de]

</li>
<li>Fixed that foreign keys named the same as the association would cause stack
overflow 437 [Eric Anderson]

</li>
<li>Fixed default scope of acts_as_list from &quot;1&quot; to &quot;1 =
1&quot;, so it&#8216;ll work in PostgreSQL (among other places) 427
[Alexey]

</li>
<li>Added Base#reload that reloads the attributes of an object from the
database 422 [Andreas Schwarz]

</li>
<li>Added SQLite3 compatibility through the sqlite3-ruby adapter by Jamis Buck
381 [Jeremy Kemper]

</li>
<li>Added support for the new protocol spoken by MySQL 4.1.1+ servers for the
Ruby/MySQL adapter that ships with <a
href="../../../../classes/Rails.html">Rails</a> 440 [Matt Mower]

</li>
<li>Added that Observers can use the observes class method instead of
overwriting self.observed_class().

<pre>
  Before:
    class ListSweeper &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
      def self.observed_class() [ List, Item ]
    end

  After:
    class ListSweeper &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
      observes List, Item
    end
</pre>
</li>
<li>Fixed that conditions in has_many and has_and_belongs_to_many should be
interpolated just like the finder_sql is

</li>
<li>Fixed Base#update_attribute to be indifferent to whether a string or symbol
is used to describe the name

</li>
<li>Added Base#toggle(attribute) and Base#toggle!(attribute) that makes it
easier to flip a switch or flag.

<pre>
  Before: topic.update_attribute(:approved, !approved?)
  After : topic.toggle!(:approved)
</pre>
</li>
<li>Added Base#increment!(attribute) and Base#decrement!(attribute) that also
saves the records. Example:

<pre>
  page.views # =&gt; 1
  page.increment!(:views) # executes an UPDATE statement
  page.views # =&gt; 2

  page.increment(:views).increment!(:views)
  page.views # =&gt; 4
</pre>
</li>
<li>Added Base#increment(attribute) and Base#decrement(attribute) that
encapsulates the += 1 and -= 1 patterns.

</li>
</ul>
<p>
*1.14.2* (April 9th, 2005)
</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed calculations for the Oracle Adapter (closes 4626) [Michael Schoen]

</li>
</ul>
<p>
*1.14.1* (April 6th, 2006)
</p>
<ul>
<li>Fix type_name_with_module to handle type names that begin with
&#8217;::&#8217;. Closes 4614. [Nicholas Seckar]

</li>
<li>Fixed that that multiparameter assignment doesn&#8216;t work with
aggregations (closes 4620) [Lars Pind]

</li>
<li>Enable Limit/Offset in Calculations (closes 4558) [lmarlow@yahoo.com]

</li>
<li>Fixed that loading including associations returns all results if Load IDs
For Limited Eager Loading returns none (closes 4528) [Rick]

</li>
<li>Fixed HasManyAssociation#find bugs when :finder_sql is set 4600
[lagroue@free.fr]

</li>
<li>Allow AR::Base#respond_to? to behave when @attributes is nil [zenspider]

</li>
<li>Support eager includes when going through a polymorphic has_many
association. [Rick]

</li>
<li>Added support for eagerly including polymorphic has_one associations.
(closes 4525) [Rick]

<pre>
  class Post &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
    has_one :tagging, :as =&gt; :taggable
  end

  Post.find :all, :include =&gt; :tagging
</pre>
</li>
<li>Added descriptive error messages for invalid has_many :through
associations: going through :has_one or :has_and_belongs_to_many [Rick]

</li>
<li>Added support for going through a polymorphic has_many association: (closes
4401) [Rick]

<pre>
  class PhotoCollection &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
    has_many :photos, :as =&gt; :photographic
    belongs_to :firm
  end

  class Firm &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
    has_many :photo_collections
    has_many :photos, :through =&gt; :photo_collections
  end
</pre>
</li>
<li>Multiple fixes and optimizations in PostgreSQL adapter, allowing
ruby-postgres gem to work properly. [ruben.nine@gmail.com]

</li>
<li>Fixed that AssociationCollection#delete_all should work even if the records
of the association are not loaded yet. [Florian Weber]

</li>
<li>Changed those private ActiveRecord methods to take optional third argument
:auto instead of nil for performance optimizations. (closes 4456) [Stefan]

</li>
<li>Private ActiveRecord methods add_limit!, add_joins!, and add_conditions!
take an OPTIONAL third argument &#8216;scope&#8217; (closes 4456) [Rick]

</li>
<li>DEPRECATED: Using additional attributes on has_and_belongs_to_many
associations. Instead upgrade your association to be a real join model
[DHH]

</li>
<li>Fixed that records returned from has_and_belongs_to_many associations with
additional attributes should be marked as read only (fixes 4512) [DHH]

</li>
<li>Do not implicitly mark recordss of has_many :through as readonly but do
mark habtm records as readonly (eventually only on join tables without rich
attributes). [Marcel Mollina Jr.]

</li>
<li>Fixed broken OCIAdapter 4457 [schoenm@earthlink.net]

</li>
</ul>
<p>
*1.14.0* (March 27th, 2006)
</p>
<ul>
<li>Replace &#8216;rescue <a
href="../../../../classes/Object.html">Object</a>&#8217; with a finer
grained rescue. Closes 4431. [Nicholas Seckar]

</li>
<li>Fixed eager loading so that an aliased table cannot clash with a
has_and_belongs_to_many join table [Rick]

</li>
<li>Add support for :include to with_scope [andrew@redlinesoftware.com]

</li>
<li>Support the use of public synonyms with the Oracle adapter; required
ruby-oci8 v0.1.14 4390 [schoenm@earthlink.net]

</li>
<li>Change periods (.) in table aliases to _&#8216;s. Closes 4251
[jeff@ministrycentered.com]

</li>
<li>Changed has_and_belongs_to_many join to INNER JOIN for Mysql 3.23.x. Closes
4348 [Rick]

</li>
<li>Fixed issue that kept :select options from being scoped [Rick]

</li>
<li>Fixed db_schema_import when binary types are present 3101 [DHH]

</li>
<li>Fixed that MySQL enums should always be returned as strings 3501 [DHH]

</li>
<li>Change has_many :through to use the :source option to specify the source
association. :class_name is now ignored. [Rick Olson]

<pre>
  class Connection &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
    belongs_to :user
    belongs_to :channel
  end

  class Channel &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
    has_many :connections
    has_many :contacts, :through =&gt; :connections, :class_name =&gt; 'User' # OLD
    has_many :contacts, :through =&gt; :connections, :source =&gt; :user      # NEW
  end
</pre>
</li>
<li>Fixed DB2 adapter so nullable columns will be determines correctly now and
quotes from column default values will be removed 4350
[contact@maik-schmidt.de]

</li>
<li>Allow overriding of find parameters in scoped has_many :through calls [Rick
Olson]

<p>
In this example, :include =&gt; false disables the default eager
association from loading. :select changes the standard select clause.
:joins specifies a join that is added to the end of the has_many :through
query.
</p>
<pre>
  class Post &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
    has_many :tags, :through =&gt; :taggings, :include =&gt; :tagging do
      def add_joins_and_select
        find :all, :select =&gt; 'tags.*, authors.id as author_id', :include =&gt; false,
          :joins =&gt; 'left outer join posts on taggings.taggable_id = posts.id left outer join authors on posts.author_id = authors.id'
      end
    end
  end
</pre>
</li>
<li>Fixed that schema changes while the database was open would break any
connections to a SQLite database (now we reconnect if that error is throw)
[DHH]

</li>
<li>Don&#8216;t classify the has_one class when eager loading, it is already
singular. Add tests. (closes 4117) [jonathan@bluewire.net.nz]

</li>
<li>Quit ignoring default :include options in has_many :through calls [Mark
James]

</li>
<li>Allow has_many :through associations to find the source association by
setting a custom class (closes 4307) [jonathan@bluewire.net.nz]

</li>
<li>Eager Loading support added for has_many :through =&gt; :has_many
associations (see below). [Rick Olson]

</li>
<li>Allow has_many :through to work on has_many associations (closes 3864)
[sco@scottraymond.net] Example:

<pre>
  class Firm &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
    has_many :clients
    has_many :invoices, :through =&gt; :clients
  end

  class Client &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
    belongs_to :firm
    has_many   :invoices
  end

  class Invoice &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
    belongs_to :client
  end
</pre>
</li>
<li>Raise error when trying to select many polymorphic objects with has_many
:through or :include (closes 4226) [josh@hasmanythrough.com]

</li>
<li>Fixed has_many :through to include :conditions set on the :through
association. closes 4020 [jonathan@bluewire.net.nz]

</li>
<li>Fix that has_many :through honors the foreign key set by the belongs_to
association in the join model (closes 4259) [andylien@gmail.com / Rick]

</li>
<li>SQL Server adapter gets some love 4298 [rtomayko@gmail.com]

</li>
<li>Added OpenBase database adapter that builds on top of the <a
href="http://www.spice-of-life.net/ruby-openbase">www.spice-of-life.net/ruby-openbase</a>/
driver. All functionality except LIMIT/OFFSET is supported 3528
[derrickspell@cdmplus.com]

</li>
<li>Rework table aliasing to account for truncated table aliases. Add smarter
table aliasing when doing eager loading of STI associations. This allows
you to use the association name in the order/where clause. [Jonathan Viney
/ Rick Olson] 4108 Example (SpecialComment is using STI):

<pre>
  Author.find(:all, :include =&gt; { :posts =&gt; :special_comments }, :order =&gt; 'special_comments.body')
</pre>
</li>
<li>Add AbstractAdapter#table_alias_for to create table aliases according to
the rules of the current adapter. [Rick]

</li>
<li>Provide access to the underlying database connection through
Adapter#raw_connection. Enables the use of db-specific methods without
complicating the adapters. 2090 [Koz]

</li>
<li>Remove broken attempts at handling columns with a default of
&#8216;now()&#8217; in the postgresql adapter. 2257 [Koz]

</li>
<li>Added connection#current_database that&#8216;ll return of the current
database (only works in MySQL, SQL Server, and Oracle so far &#8212; please
help implement for the rest of the adapters) 3663 [Tom ward]

</li>
<li>Fixed that Migration#execute would have the table name prefix appended to
its query 4110 [mark.imbriaco@pobox.com]

</li>
<li>Make all tinyint(1) variants act like boolean in mysql (tinyint(1)
unsigned, etc.) [Jamis Buck]

</li>
<li>Use association&#8216;s :conditions when eager loading.
[jeremyevans0@gmail.com] 4144

</li>
<li>Alias the has_and_belongs_to_many join table on eager includes. 4106
[jeremyevans0@gmail.com]

<p>
This statement would normally error because the projects_developers table
is joined twice, and therefore joined_on would be ambiguous.
</p>
<pre>
  Developer.find(:all, :include =&gt; {:projects =&gt; :developers}, :conditions =&gt; 'join_project_developers.joined_on IS NOT NULL')
</pre>
</li>
<li>Oracle adapter gets some love 4230 [schoenm@earthlink.net]

<pre>
  * Changes :text to CLOB rather than BLOB [Moses Hohman]
  * Fixes an issue with nil numeric length/scales (several)
  * Implements support for XMLTYPE columns [wilig / Kubo Takehiro]
  * Tweaks a unit test to get it all green again
  * Adds support for #current_database
</pre>
</li>
<li>Added Base.abstract_class? that marks which classes are not part of the
Active Record hierarchy 3704 [Rick Olson]

<pre>
  class CachedModel &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
    self.abstract_class = true
  end

  class Post &lt; CachedModel
  end

  CachedModel.abstract_class?
  =&gt; true

  Post.abstract_class?
  =&gt; false

  Post.base_class
  =&gt; Post

  Post.table_name
  =&gt; 'posts'
</pre>
</li>
<li>Allow :dependent options to be used with polymorphic joins. 3820 [Rick
Olson]

<pre>
  class Foo &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
    has_many :attachments, :as =&gt; :attachable, :dependent =&gt; :delete_all
  end
</pre>
</li>
<li>Nicer error message on has_many :through when :through reflection can not
be found. 4042 [court3nay@gmail.com]

</li>
<li>Upgrade to Transaction::Simple 1.3 [Jamis Buck]

</li>
<li>Catch FixtureClassNotFound when using instantiated fixtures on a fixture
that has no ActiveRecord model [Rick Olson]

</li>
<li>Allow ordering of calculated results and/or grouped fields in calculations
[solo@gatelys.com]

</li>
<li>Make ActiveRecord::Base#save! return true instead of nil on success. 4173
[johan@johansorensen.com]

</li>
<li>Dynamically set allow_concurrency. 4044 [Stefan Kaes]

</li>
<li>Added Base#to_xml that&#8216;ll turn the current record into a XML
representation [DHH]. Example:

<pre>
  topic.to_xml
</pre>
<p>
&#8230;returns:
</p>
<pre>
  &lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot;?&gt;
  &lt;topic&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;The First Topic&lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;author-name&gt;David&lt;/author-name&gt;
    &lt;id type=&quot;integer&quot;&gt;1&lt;/id&gt;
    &lt;approved type=&quot;boolean&quot;&gt;false&lt;/approved&gt;
    &lt;replies-count type=&quot;integer&quot;&gt;0&lt;/replies-count&gt;
    &lt;bonus-time type=&quot;datetime&quot;&gt;2000-01-01 08:28:00&lt;/bonus-time&gt;
    &lt;written-on type=&quot;datetime&quot;&gt;2003-07-16 09:28:00&lt;/written-on&gt;
    &lt;content&gt;Have a nice day&lt;/content&gt;
    &lt;author-email-address&gt;david@loudthinking.com&lt;/author-email-address&gt;
    &lt;parent-id&gt;&lt;/parent-id&gt;
    &lt;last-read type=&quot;date&quot;&gt;2004-04-15&lt;/last-read&gt;
  &lt;/topic&gt;
</pre>
<p>
&#8230;and you can configure with:
</p>
<pre>
  topic.to_xml(:skip_instruct =&gt; true, :except =&gt; [ :id, bonus_time, :written_on, replies_count ])
</pre>
<p>
&#8230;that&#8216;ll return:
</p>
<pre>
  &lt;topic&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;The First Topic&lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;author-name&gt;David&lt;/author-name&gt;
    &lt;approved type=&quot;boolean&quot;&gt;false&lt;/approved&gt;
    &lt;content&gt;Have a nice day&lt;/content&gt;
    &lt;author-email-address&gt;david@loudthinking.com&lt;/author-email-address&gt;
    &lt;parent-id&gt;&lt;/parent-id&gt;
    &lt;last-read type=&quot;date&quot;&gt;2004-04-15&lt;/last-read&gt;
  &lt;/topic&gt;
</pre>
<p>
You can even do load first-level associations as part of the document:
</p>
<pre>
  firm.to_xml :include =&gt; [ :account, :clients ]
</pre>
<p>
&#8230;that&#8216;ll return something like:
</p>
<pre>
  &lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot;?&gt;
  &lt;firm&gt;
    &lt;id type=&quot;integer&quot;&gt;1&lt;/id&gt;
    &lt;rating type=&quot;integer&quot;&gt;1&lt;/rating&gt;
    &lt;name&gt;37signals&lt;/name&gt;
    &lt;clients&gt;
      &lt;client&gt;
        &lt;rating type=&quot;integer&quot;&gt;1&lt;/rating&gt;
        &lt;name&gt;Summit&lt;/name&gt;
      &lt;/client&gt;
      &lt;client&gt;
        &lt;rating type=&quot;integer&quot;&gt;1&lt;/rating&gt;
        &lt;name&gt;Microsoft&lt;/name&gt;
      &lt;/client&gt;
    &lt;/clients&gt;
    &lt;account&gt;
      &lt;id type=&quot;integer&quot;&gt;1&lt;/id&gt;
      &lt;credit-limit type=&quot;integer&quot;&gt;50&lt;/credit-limit&gt;
    &lt;/account&gt;
  &lt;/firm&gt;
</pre>
</li>
<li>Allow :counter_cache to take a column name for custom counter cache columns
[Jamis Buck]

</li>
<li>Documentation fixes for :dependent [robby@planetargon.com]

</li>
<li>Stop the MySQL adapter crashing when views are present. 3782 [Jonathan
Viney]

</li>
<li>Don&#8216;t classify the belongs_to class, it is already singular 4117
[keithm@infused.org]

</li>
<li>Allow set_fixture_class to take Classes instead of strings for a class in a
module. Raise FixtureClassNotFound if a fixture can&#8216;t load. [Rick
Olson]

</li>
<li>Fix quoting of inheritance column for STI eager loading 4098 [Jonathan
Viney &lt;jonathan@bluewire.net.nz&gt;]

</li>
<li>Added smarter table aliasing for eager associations for multiple self joins
3580 [Rick Olson]

<pre>
  * The first time a table is referenced in a join, no alias is used.
  * After that, the parent class name and the reflection name are used.

      Tree.find(:all, :include =&gt; :children) # LEFT OUTER JOIN trees AS tree_children ...

  * Any additional join references get a numerical suffix like '_2', '_3', etc.
</pre>
</li>
<li>Fixed eager loading problems with single-table inheritance 3580 [Rick
Olson]. Post.find(:all, :include =&gt; :special_comments) now returns all
posts, and any special comments that the posts may have. And made STI work
with has_many :through and polymorphic belongs_to.

</li>
<li>Added cascading eager loading that allows for queries like
Author.find(:all, :include=&gt; { :posts=&gt; :comments }), which will
fetch all authors, their posts, and the comments belonging to those posts
in a single query (using LEFT OUTER JOIN) 3913 [anna@wota.jp]. Examples:

<pre>
  # cascaded in two levels
  &gt;&gt; Author.find(:all, :include=&gt;{:posts=&gt;:comments})
  =&gt; authors
       +- posts
            +- comments

  # cascaded in two levels and normal association
  &gt;&gt; Author.find(:all, :include=&gt;[{:posts=&gt;:comments}, :categorizations])
  =&gt; authors
       +- posts
            +- comments
       +- categorizations

  # cascaded in two levels with two has_many associations
  &gt;&gt; Author.find(:all, :include=&gt;{:posts=&gt;[:comments, :categorizations]})
  =&gt; authors
       +- posts
            +- comments
            +- categorizations

  # cascaded in three levels
  &gt;&gt; Company.find(:all, :include=&gt;{:groups=&gt;{:members=&gt;{:favorites}}})
  =&gt; companies
       +- groups
            +- members
                 +- favorites
</pre>
</li>
<li>Make counter cache work when replacing an association 3245
[eugenol@gmail.com]

</li>
<li>Make migrations verbose [Jamis Buck]

</li>
<li>Make counter_cache work with polymorphic belongs_to [Jamis Buck]

</li>
<li>Fixed that calling HasOneProxy#build_model repeatedly would cause saving to
happen 4058 [anna@wota.jp]

</li>
<li>Added Sybase database adapter that relies on the Sybase Open Client
bindings (see <a
href="http://raa.ruby-lang.org/project/sybase-ctlib">raa.ruby-lang.org/project/sybase-ctlib</a>)
3765 [John Sheets]. It&#8216;s almost completely Active Record compliant
(including migrations), but has the following caveats:

<pre>
  * Does not support DATE SQL column types; use DATETIME instead.
  * Date columns on HABTM join tables are returned as String, not Time.
  * Insertions are potentially broken for :polymorphic join tables
  * BLOB column access not yet fully supported
</pre>
</li>
<li>Clear stale, cached connections left behind by defunct threads. [Jeremy
Kemper]

</li>
<li>CHANGED DEFAULT: set ActiveRecord::Base.allow_concurrency to false. Most AR
usage is in single-threaded applications. [Jeremy Kemper]

</li>
<li>Renamed the &quot;oci&quot; adapter to &quot;oracle&quot;, but kept the old
name as an alias 4017 [schoenm@earthlink.net]

</li>
<li>Fixed that Base.save should always return false if the save didn&#8216;t
succeed, including if it has halted by before_save&#8216;s 1861, 2477 [DHH]

</li>
<li>Speed up class -&gt; connection caching and stale connection verification.
3979 [Stefan Kaes]

</li>
<li>Add set_fixture_class to allow the use of table name accessors with models
which use set_table_name. [Kevin Clark]

</li>
<li>Added that fixtures to placed in subdirectories of the main fixture files
are also loaded 3937 [dblack@wobblini.net]

</li>
<li>Define attribute query methods to avoid method_missing calls. 3677
[jonathan@bluewire.net.nz]

</li>
<li>ActiveRecord::Base.remove_connection explicitly closes database connections
and doesn&#8216;t corrupt the connection cache. Introducing the disconnect!
instance method for the PostgreSQL, MySQL, and SQL Server adapters;
implementations for the others are welcome. 3591 [Simon Stapleton, Tom
Ward]

</li>
<li>Added support for nested scopes 3407 [anna@wota.jp]. Examples:

<pre>
  Developer.with_scope(:find =&gt; { :conditions =&gt; &quot;salary &gt; 10000&quot;, :limit =&gt; 10 }) do
    Developer.find(:all)     # =&gt; SELECT * FROM developers WHERE (salary &gt; 10000) LIMIT 10

    # inner rule is used. (all previous parameters are ignored)
    Developer.with_exclusive_scope(:find =&gt; { :conditions =&gt; &quot;name = 'Jamis'&quot; }) do
      Developer.find(:all)   # =&gt; SELECT * FROM developers WHERE (name = 'Jamis')
    end

    # parameters are merged
    Developer.with_scope(:find =&gt; { :conditions =&gt; &quot;name = 'Jamis'&quot; }) do
      Developer.find(:all)   # =&gt; SELECT * FROM developers WHERE (( salary &gt; 10000 ) AND ( name = 'Jamis' )) LIMIT 10
    end
  end
</pre>
</li>
<li>Fixed db2 connection with empty user_name and auth options 3622
[phurley@gmail.com]

</li>
<li>Fixed validates_length_of to work on UTF-8 strings by using characters
instead of bytes 3699 [Masao Mutoh]

</li>
<li>Fixed that reflections would bleed across class boundaries in single-table
inheritance setups 3796 [lars@pind.com]

</li>
<li>Added calculations: Base.count, Base.average, Base.sum, Base.minimum,
Base.maxmium, and the generic Base.calculate. All can be used with :group
and :having. Calculations and statitics need no longer require custom SQL.
3958 [Rick Olson]. Examples:

<pre>
  Person.average :age
  Person.minimum :age
  Person.maximum :age
  Person.sum :salary, :group =&gt; :last_name
</pre>
</li>
<li>Renamed Errors#count to Errors#size but kept an alias for the old name (and
included an alias for length too) 3920 [contact@lukeredpath.co.uk]

</li>
<li>Reflections don&#8216;t attempt to resolve module nesting of association
classes. Simplify type computation. [Jeremy Kemper]

</li>
<li>Improved the Oracle OCI Adapter with better performance for column
reflection (from 3210), fixes to migrations (from 3476 and 3742), tweaks to
unit tests (from 3610), and improved documentation (from 2446) 3879
[Aggregated by schoenm@earthlink.net]

</li>
<li>Fixed that the schema_info table used by ActiveRecord::Schema.define should
respect table pre- and suffixes 3834 [rubyonrails@atyp.de]

</li>
<li>Added :select option to Base.count that&#8216;ll allow you to select
something else than * to be counted on. Especially important for count
queries using DISTINCT 3839 [skaes]

</li>

3661 [shugo@ruby-lang.org]

</li>
<li>Add documentation for add_index and remove_index. 3600 [Manfred Stienstra
&lt;m.stienstra@fngtps.com&gt;]

</li>
<li>If the OCI library is not available, raise an exception indicating as much.
3593 [schoenm@earthlink.net]

</li>
<li>Add explicit :order in finder tests as postgresql orders results
differently by default. 3577. [Rick Olson]

</li>
<li>Make dynamic finders honor additional passed in :conditions. 3569 [Oleg

</li>
<li>When AbstractAdapter#log rescues an exception, attempt to detect and
reconnect to an inactive database connection. Connection adapter must
respond to the active? and reconnect! instance methods. Initial support for
PostgreSQL, MySQL, and SQLite. Make certain that all statements which may
need reconnection are performed within a logged block: for example, this
means no avoiding log(sql, name) { } if @logger.nil? 428 [Jeremy Kemper]

</li>
<li>Upgrade bundled ruby-mysql 0.2.4 with mysql411 shim (see 440) to ruby-mysql

</li>
<li>Deprecate the old, confusing :exclusively_dependent option in favor of

</li>
<li>More compatible Oracle column reflection. 2771 [Ryan Davis
&lt;ryand-ruby@zenspider.com&gt;, Michael Schoen
&lt;schoenm@earthlink.net&gt;]

</li>
</ul>
<p>
*1.13.0* (November 7th, 2005)
</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed faulty regex in get_table_name method (SQLServerAdapter) 2639 [Ryan
Tomayko]

</li>
<li>Added :include as an option for association declarations [DHH]. Example:

<pre>
  has_many :posts, :include =&gt; [ :author, :comments ]
</pre>
</li>
<li>Rename Base.constrain to Base.with_scope so it doesn&#8216;t conflict with
existing concept of database constraints. Make scoping more robust: uniform
method =&gt; parameters, validated method names and supported finder
parameters, raise exception on nested scopes. [Jeremy Kemper] Example:

<pre>
  Comment.with_scope(:find =&gt; { :conditions =&gt; 'active=true' }, :create =&gt; { :post_id =&gt; 5 }) do
    # Find where name = ? and active=true
    Comment.find :all, :conditions =&gt; ['name = ?', name]
    # Create comment associated with :post_id
    Comment.create :body =&gt; &quot;Hello world&quot;
  end
</pre>
</li>
<li>Fixed that SQL Server should ignore :size declarations on anything but
integer and string in the agnostic schema representation 2756 [Ryan
Tomayko]

</li>
<li>Added constrain scoping for creates using a hash of attributes bound to the
:creation key [DHH]. Example:

<pre>
  Comment.constrain(:creation =&gt; { :post_id =&gt; 5 }) do
    # Associated with :post_id
    Comment.create :body =&gt; &quot;Hello world&quot;
  end
</pre>
<p>
This is rarely used directly, but allows for find_or_create on
associations. So you can do:
</p>
<pre>
  # If the tag doesn't exist, a new one is created that's associated with the person
  person.tags.find_or_create_by_name(&quot;Summer&quot;)
</pre>
</li>
<li>Added find_or_create_by_X as a second type of dynamic finder that&#8216;ll
create the record if it doesn&#8216;t already exist [DHH]. Example:

<pre>
  # No 'Summer' tag exists
  Tag.find_or_create_by_name(&quot;Summer&quot;) # equal to Tag.create(:name =&gt; &quot;Summer&quot;)

  # Now the 'Summer' tag does exist
  Tag.find_or_create_by_name(&quot;Summer&quot;) # equal to Tag.find_by_name(&quot;Summer&quot;)
</pre>
</li>
<li>Added extension capabilities to has_many and has_and_belongs_to_many
proxies [DHH]. Example:

<pre>
  class Account &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
    has_many :people do
      def find_or_create_by_name(name)
        first_name, *last_name = name.split
        last_name = last_name.join &quot; &quot;

        find_or_create_by_first_name_and_last_name(first_name, last_name)
      end
    end
  end

  person = Account.find(:first).people.find_or_create_by_name(&quot;David Heinemeier Hansson&quot;)
  person.first_name # =&gt; &quot;David&quot;
  person.last_name  # =&gt; &quot;Heinemeier Hansson&quot;
</pre>
<p>
Note that the anoymous module must be declared using brackets, not do/end
(due to order of evaluation).

<li>Omit internal dtproperties table from SQLServer table list. 2729
[rtomayko@gmail.com]

</li>
<li>Quote column names in generated SQL. 2728 [rtomayko@gmail.com]

</li>
<li>Correct the pure-Ruby MySQL 4.1.1 shim&#8216;s version test. 2718 [Jeremy
Kemper]

</li>
<li>Add Model.create! to match existing model.save! method. When save! raises
RecordInvalid, you can catch the exception, retrieve the invalid record
(invalid_exception.record), and see its errors
(invalid_exception.record.errors). [Jeremy Kemper]

</li>
<li>Correct fixture behavior when table name pluralization is off. 2719 [Rick
Bradley &lt;rick@rickbradley.com&gt;]

</li>
<li>Changed :dbfile to :database for SQLite adapter for consistency (old key
still works as an alias) 2644 [Dan Peterson]

</li>
<li>Added migration support for Oracle 2647 [Michael Schoen]

</li>
<li>Worked around that connection can&#8216;t be reset if allow_concurrency is
off. 2648 [Michael Schoen &lt;schoenm@earthlink.net&gt;]

</li>
<li>Fixed SQL Server adapter to pass even more tests and do even better 2634
[rtomayko@gmail.com]

</li>
<li>Fixed SQL Server adapter so it honors options[:conditions] when applying
:limits 1978 [Tom Ward]

</li>
<li>Added migration support to SQL Server adapter (please someone do the same
for Oracle and DB2) 2625 [Tom Ward]

</li>
<li>Use AR::Base.silence rather than AR::Base.logger.silence in fixtures to
preserve Log4r compatibility. 2618 [dansketcher@gmail.com]

</li>
<li>Constraints are cloned so they can&#8216;t be inadvertently modified while
they&#8216;re

</li>
</ul>
<p>
in effect. Added :readonly finder constraint. Calling an association
collection&#8216;s class method (Part.foobar via item.parts.foobar)
constrains :readonly =&gt; false since the collection&#8216;s :joins
constraint would otherwise force it to true. [Jeremy Kemper
&lt;rails@bitsweat.net&gt;]
</p>
<ul>
<li>Added :offset and :limit to the kinds of options that Base.constrain can
use 2466 [duane.johnson@gmail.com]

</li>
<li>Fixed handling of nil number columns on Oracle and cleaned up tests for
Oracle in general 2555 [schoenm@earthlink.net]

</li>
<li>Added quoted_true and quoted_false methods and tables to db2_adapter and
cleaned up tests for DB2 2493, 2624 [maik schmidt]

STI and constraints.

</li>
<li>Correct PostgreSQL primary key sequence detection. 2507

<li>Added support for using limits in eager loads that involve has_many and
has_and_belongs_to_many associations

*1.12.0* (October 16th, 2005)
</p>
<ul>
<li>Update/clean up documentation (rdoc)

&lt;robby@planetargon.com&gt;]

</li>
<li>Change default logging colors to work on both white and black backgrounds.
[Sam Stephenson]

</li>
<li>YAML fixtures support ordered hashes for fixtures with foreign key
dependencies in the same table. 1896 [purestorm@ggnore.net]

</li>
<li>:dependent now accepts :nullify option. Sets the foreign key of the related
objects to NULL instead of deleting them. 2015 [Robby Russell
&lt;robby@planetargon.com&gt;]

</li>
<li>Introduce read-only records. If you call object.readonly! then it will mark
the object as read-only and raise ReadOnlyRecord if you call object.save.
object.readonly? reports whether the object is read-only. Passing :readonly
=&gt; true to any finder method will mark returned records as read-only.
The :joins option now implies :readonly, so if you use this option, saving
the same record will now fail. Use find_by_sql to work around.

</li>
<li>Avoid memleak in dev mode when using fcgi

</li>
<li>Simplified .clear on active record associations by using the existing
delete_records method. 1906 [Caleb &lt;me@cpb.ca&gt;]

<li>Improved migrations&#8217; behavior when the schema_info table is empty.
[Nicholas Seckar]

</li>
<li>Fixed that Observers didn&#8216;t observe sub-classes 627 [Florian Weber]

</li>
<li>Fix eager loading error messages, allow :include to specify tables using
strings or symbols. Closes 2222 [Marcel Molina]

</li>
<li>Added check for RAILS_CONNECTION_ADAPTERS on startup and only load the
connection adapters specified within if its present (available in <a
href="../../../../classes/Rails.html">Rails</a> through
config.connection_adapters using the new config) 1958 [skae]

</li>
<li>Fixed various problems with has_and_belongs_to_many when using customer
finder_sql 2094 [Florian Weber]

</li>
<li>Added better exception error when unknown column types are used with
migrations 1814 [fbeausoleil@ftml.net]

</li>
<li>Fixed &quot;connection lost&quot; issue with the bundled Ruby/MySQL driver
(would kill the app after 8 hours of inactivity) 2163, 428
[kajism@yahoo.com]

</li>
<li>Fixed comparison of Active Record objects so two new objects are not equal
2099 [deberg]

</li>
<li>Fixed that the SQL Server adapter would sometimes return DBI::Timestamp
objects instead of Time 2127 [Tom Ward]

</li>
<li>Added the instance methods root and ancestors on acts_as_tree and fixed
siblings to not include the current node 2142, 2140 [coffee2code]

</li>
<li>Fixed that Active Record would call SHOW FIELDS twice (or more) for the
same model when the cached results were available 1947 [sd@notso.net]

</li>
<li>Added log_level and use_silence parameter to ActiveRecord::Base.benchmark.
The first controls at what level the benchmark statement will be logged
(now as debug, instead of info) and the second that can be passed false to
include all logging statements during the benchmark block/

</li>
<li>Make sure the schema_info table is created before querying the current
version 1903

</li>
<li><a href="../../../../classes/Fixtures.html">Fixtures</a> ignore table name
prefix and suffix 1987 [Jakob S]

</li>
<li>Add documentation for index_type argument to add_index method for
migrations 2005 [blaine@odeo.com]

</li>
<li>Modify read_attribute to allow a symbol argument 2024 [Ken Kunz]

</li>
<li>Make destroy return self 1913 [sebastian.kanthak@muehlheim.de]

</li>
<li>Fix typo in validations documentation 1938 [court3nay]

</li>
<li>Make acts_as_list work for insert_at(1) 1966 [hensleyl@papermountain.org]

</li>
<li>Fix typo in count_by_sql documentation 1969 [Alexey Verkhovsky]

</li>
<li>Allow add_column and create_table to specify NOT NULL 1712
[emptysands@gmail.com]

</li>
<li>Fix create_table so that id column is implicitly added [Rick Olson]

</li>
<li>Default sequence names for Oracle changed to #{table_name}_seq, which is
the most commonly used standard. In addition, a new method
ActiveRecord::Base#set_sequence_name allows the developer to set the
sequence name per model. This is a non-backwards-compatible change &#8212;
anyone using the old-style &quot;rails_sequence&quot; will need to either
create new sequences, or set: ActiveRecord::Base.set_sequence_name =
&quot;rails_sequence&quot; 1798

</li>
<li>OCIAdapter now properly handles synonyms, which are commonly used to
separate out the schema owner from the application user 1798

</li>
<li>Fixed the handling of camelCase columns names in Oracle 1798

</li>
<li>Implemented for OCI the Rakefile tasks of :clone_structure_to_test,
:db_structure_dump, and :purge_test_database, which enable Oracle folks to
enjoy all the agile goodness of <a
href="../../../../classes/Rails.html">Rails</a> for testing. Note that the
current implementation is fairly limited &#8212; only tables and sequences
are cloned, not constraints or indexes. A full clone in Oracle generally
requires some manual effort, and is version-specific. Post 9i, Oracle
recommends the use of the DBMS_METADATA package, though that approach
requires editing of the physical characteristics generated 1798

</li>
<li>Fixed the handling of multiple blob columns in Oracle if one or more of
them are null 1798

</li>
<li>Added support for calling constrained class methods on has_many and
has_and_belongs_to_many collections 1764 [Tobias Luetke]

<pre>
  class Comment &lt; AR:B
    def self.search(q)
      find(:all, :conditions =&gt; [&quot;body = ?&quot;, q])
    end
  end

  class Post &lt; AR:B
    has_many :comments
  end

  Post.find(1).comments.search('hi') # =&gt; SELECT * from comments WHERE post_id = 1 AND body = 'hi'
</pre>
<p>
NOTICE: This patch changes the underlying SQL generated by
has_and_belongs_to_many queries. If your relying on that, such as by
explicitly referencing the old t and j aliases, you&#8216;ll need to update
your code. Of course, you _shouldn&#8216;t_ be relying on details like that
no less than you should be diving in to touch private variables. But just
in case you do, consider yourself noticed :)
</p>
</li>
<li>Added migration support for SQLite (using temporary tables to simulate
ALTER TABLE) 1771 [Sam Stephenson]

</li>
<li>Remove extra definition of supports_migrations? from abstract_adaptor.rb
[Nicholas Seckar]

</li>
<li>Fix acts_as_list so that moving next-to-last item to the bottom does not
result in duplicate item positions

</li>
<li>Fixed incompatibility in DB2 adapter with the new limit/offset approach
1718 [Maik Schmidt]

</li>
<li>Added :select option to find which can specify a different value than the
default *, like find(:all, :select =&gt; &quot;first_name,
last_name&quot;), if you either only want to select part of the columns or
exclude columns otherwise included from a join 1338 [Stefan Kaes]

</li>
</ul>
<p>
*1.11.1* (11 July, 2005)
</p>
<ul>
<li>Added support for limit and offset with eager loading of has_one and
belongs_to associations. Using the options with has_many and
has_and_belongs_to_many associations will now raise an <a
href="../../../../classes/ActiveRecord/ConfigurationError.html">ActiveRecord::ConfigurationError</a>
1692 [Rick Olsen]

</li>
<li>Fixed that assume_bottom_position (in acts_as_list) could be called on
items already last in the list and they would move one position away from
the list 1648 [tyler@kianta.com]

</li>
<li>Added ActiveRecord::Base.threaded_connections flag to turn off 1-connection
per thread (required for thread safety). By default it&#8216;s on, but
WEBrick in <a href="../../../../classes/Rails.html">Rails</a> need it off
1685 [Sam Stephenson]

</li>
<li>Correct reflected table name for singular associations. 1688
[court3nay@gmail.com]

</li>
<li>Fixed optimistic locking with SQL Server 1660 [tom@popdog.net]

</li>
<li>Added ActiveRecord::Migrator.migrate that can figure out whether to go up
or down based on the target version and the current

</li>
<li>Added better error message for &quot;packets out of order&quot; 1630
[courtenay]

</li>
<li>Fixed first run of &quot;rake migrate&quot; on PostgreSQL by not expecting
a return value on the id 1640

</li>
</ul>
<p>
*1.11.0* (6 July, 2005)
</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed that Yaml error message in fixtures hid the real error 1623 [Nicholas
Seckar]

</li>
<li>Changed logging of SQL statements to use the DEBUG level instead of INFO

</li>
<li>Added new Migrations framework for describing schema transformations in a
way that can be easily applied across multiple databases 1604 [Tobias
Luetke] See documentation under <a
href="../../../../classes/ActiveRecord/Migration.html">ActiveRecord::Migration</a>
and the additional support in the <a
href="../../../../classes/Rails.html">Rails</a> rakefile/generator.

</li>
<li>Added callback hooks to association collections 1549 [Florian Weber].
Example:

<pre>
  class Project
    has_and_belongs_to_many :developers, :before_add =&gt; :evaluate_velocity

    def evaluate_velocity(developer)
      ...
    end
  end
</pre>
<p>
..raising an exception will cause the object not to be added (or removed,
with before_remove).
</p>
</li>
<li>Fixed Base.content_columns call for SQL Server adapter 1450 [DeLynn Berry]

</li>
<li>Fixed Base#write_attribute to work with both symbols and strings 1190 [Paul
Legato]

</li>
<li>Fixed that has_and_belongs_to_many didn&#8216;t respect single table
inheritance types 1081 [Florian Weber]

</li>
<li>Speed up ActiveRecord#method_missing for the common case (read_attribute).

</li>
<li>Only notify observers on after_find and after_initialize if these methods
are defined on the model. 1235 [skaes@web.de]

</li>
<li>Fixed that single-table inheritance sub-classes couldn&#8216;t be used to
limit the result set with eager loading 1215 [Chris McGrath]

</li>
<li>Fixed validates_numericality_of to work with overrided getter-method when
:allow_nil is on 1316 [raidel@onemail.at]

</li>
<li>Added roots, root, and siblings to the batch of methods added by
acts_as_tree 1541 [michael@schuerig.de]

</li>
<li>Added support for limit/offset with the MS SQL Server driver so that
pagination will now work 1569 [DeLynn Berry]

</li>
<li>Added support for ODBC connections to MS SQL Server so you can connect from
a non-Windows machine 1569 [Mark Imbriaco/DeLynn Berry]

</li>
<li>Fixed that multiparameter posts ignored attr_protected 1532
[alec+rails@veryclever.net]

</li>
<li>Fixed problem with eager loading when using a has_and_belongs_to_many
association using :association_foreign_key 1504
[flash@vanklinkenbergsoftware.nl]

</li>
<li>Fixed Base#find to honor the documentation on how :joins work and make them
consistent with Base#count 1405 [pritchie@gmail.com]. What used to be:

<pre>
  Developer.find :all, :joins =&gt; 'developers_projects', :conditions =&gt; 'id=developer_id AND project_id=1'
</pre>
<p>
&#8230;should instead be:
</p>
<pre>
  Developer.find(
    :all,
    :joins =&gt; 'LEFT JOIN developers_projects ON developers.id = developers_projects.developer_id',
    :conditions =&gt; 'project_id=1'
  )
</pre>
</li>
<li>Fixed that validations didn&#8216;t respecting custom setting for
too_short, too_long messages 1437 [Marcel Molina]

</li>
<li>Fixed that clear_association_cache doesn&#8216;t delete new associations on
new records (so you can safely place new records in the session with Action
Pack without having new associations wiped) 1494 [cluon]

</li>
<li>Fixed that calling Model.find([]) returns [] and doesn&#8216;t throw an
exception 1379

</li>
<li>Fixed that adding a record to a has_and_belongs_to collection would always
save it &#8212; now it only saves if its a new record 1203 [Alisdair
McDiarmid]

</li>
<li>Fixed saving of in-memory association structures to happen as a
after_create/after_update callback instead of after_save &#8212; that way
you can add new associations in after_create/after_update callbacks without
getting them saved twice

</li>
<li>Allow any <a href="../../../../classes/Enumerable.html">Enumerable</a>, not
just Array, to work as bind variables 1344 [Jeremy Kemper]

</li>
<li>Added actual database-changing behavior to collection assigment for
has_many and has_and_belongs_to_many 1425 [Sebastian Kanthak]. Example:

<pre>
  david.projects = [Project.find(1), Project.new(&quot;name&quot; =&gt; &quot;ActionWebSearch&quot;)]
  david.save
</pre>
<p>
If david.projects already contain the project with ID 1, this is left
unchanged. Any other projects are dropped. And the new project is saved
when david.save is called.
</p>
<p>
Also included is a way to do assignments through IDs, which is perfect for
checkbox updating, so you get to do:
</p>
<pre>
  david.project_ids = [1, 5, 7]
</pre>
</li>
<li>Corrected typo in find SQL for has_and_belongs_to_many. 1312
[ben@bensinclair.com]

</li>
<li>Fixed sanitized conditions for has_many finder method. 1281
[jackc@hylesanderson.com, pragdave, Tobias Luetke]

</li>
<li>Comprehensive PostgreSQL schema support. Use the optional
schema_search_path directive in database.yml to give a comma-separated list
of schemas to search for your tables. This allows you, for example, to have
tables in a shared schema without having to use a custom table name. See <a
href="http://www.postgresql.org/docs/8.0/interactive/ddl-schemas.html">www.postgresql.org/docs/8.0/interactive/ddl-schemas.html</a>
to learn more. 827 [dave@cherryville.org]

</li>
<li>Corrected @@configurations typo 1410 [david@ruppconsulting.com]

</li>
<li>Return PostgreSQL columns in the order they were declared 1374
[perlguy@gmail.com]

</li>
<li>Allow before/after update hooks to work on models using optimistic locking

</li>
<li>Eager loading of dependent has_one associations won&#8216;t delete the
association 1212

</li>
<li>Added a second parameter to the build and create method for has_one that
controls whether the existing association should be replaced (which means
nullifying its foreign key as well). By default this is true, but false can
be passed to prevent it.

</li>
<li>Using transactional fixtures now causes the data to be loaded only once.

</li>
<li>Added fixture accessor methods that can be used when instantiated fixtures
are disabled.

<pre>
  fixtures :web_sites

  def test_something
    assert_equal &quot;Ruby on Rails&quot;, web_sites(:rubyonrails).name
  end
</pre>
</li>
<li>Added DoubleRenderError exception that&#8216;ll be raised if render* is
called twice 518 [Nicholas Seckar]

</li>
<li>Fixed exceptions occuring after render has been called 1096 [Nicholas
Seckar]

</li>
<li>CHANGED: validates_presence_of now uses Errors#add_on_blank, which will
make &quot; &quot; fail the validation where it didn&#8216;t before 1309

</li>
<li>Added Errors#add_on_blank which works like Errors#add_on_empty, but uses
Object#blank? instead

</li>
<li>Added the :if option to all validations that can either use a block or a
method pointer to determine whether the validation should be run or not.
1324 [Duane Johnson/jhosteny]. Examples:

<p>
Conditional validations such as the following are made possible:
</p>
<pre>
  validates_numericality_of :income, :if =&gt; :employed?
</pre>
<p>
Conditional validations can also solve the salted login generator problem:
</p>
<pre>
  validates_confirmation_of :password, :if =&gt; :new_password?
</pre>
<p>
Using blocks:
</p>
<pre>
  validates_presence_of :username, :if =&gt; Proc.new { |user| user.signup_step &gt; 1 }
</pre>
</li>
<li>Fixed use of construct_finder_sql when using :join 1288 [dwlt@dwlt.net]

</li>
<li>Fixed that :delete_sql in has_and_belongs_to_many associations
couldn&#8216;t access record properties 1299 [Rick Olson]

</li>
<li>Fixed that clone would break when an aggregate had the same name as one of
its attributes 1307 [Jeremy Kemper]

</li>
<li>Changed that destroying an object will only freeze the attributes hash,
which keeps the object from having attributes changed (as that
wouldn&#8216;t make sense), but allows for the querying of associations
after it has been destroyed.

</li>
<li>Changed the callbacks such that observers are notified before the in-object
callbacks are triggered. Without this change, it wasn&#8216;t possible to
act on the whole object in something like a before_destroy observer without
having the objects own callbacks (like deleting associations) called first.

</li>
<li>Added option for passing an array to the find_all version of the dynamic
finders and have it evaluated as an IN fragment. Example:

<pre>
  # SELECT * FROM topics WHERE title IN ('First', 'Second')
  Topic.find_all_by_title([&quot;First&quot;, &quot;Second&quot;])
</pre>
</li>
<li>Added compatibility with camelCase column names for dynamic finders 533
[Dee.Zsombor]

</li>
<li>Fixed extraneous comma in count() function that made it not work with joins
1156 [jarkko/Dee.Zsombor]

</li>
<li>Fixed incompatibility with Base#find with an array of ids that would fail
when using eager loading 1186 [Alisdair McDiarmid]

</li>
<li>Fixed that validate_length_of lost :on option when :within was specified
1195 [jhosteny@mac.com]

</li>
<li>Added encoding and min_messages options for PostgreSQL 1205 [shugo].
Configuration example:

<pre>
  development:
    adapter: postgresql
    database: rails_development
    host: localhost
    username: postgres
    password:
    encoding: UTF8
    min_messages: ERROR
</pre>
</li>
<li>Fixed acts_as_list where deleting an item that was removed from the list
would ruin the positioning of other list items 1197 [Jamis Buck]

</li>
<li>Added validates_exclusion_of as a negative of validates_inclusion_of

</li>
<li>Optimized counting of has_many associations by setting the association to
empty if the count is 0 so repeated calls doesn&#8216;t trigger database
calls

</li>
</ul>
<p>
*1.10.1* (20th April, 2005)
</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed frivilous database queries being triggered with eager loading on
empty associations and other things

</li>
<li>Fixed order of loading in eager associations

</li>
<li>Fixed stray comma when using eager loading and ordering together from
has_many associations 1143

</li>
</ul>
<p>
*1.10.0* (19th April, 2005)
</p>
<ul>
<li>Added eager loading of associations as a way to solve the N+1 problem more
gracefully without piggy-back queries. Example:

<pre>
  for post in Post.find(:all, :limit =&gt; 100)
    puts &quot;Post:            &quot; + post.title
    puts &quot;Written by:      &quot; + post.author.name
    puts &quot;Last comment on: &quot; + post.comments.first.created_on
  end
</pre>
<p>
This used to generate 301 database queries if all 100 posts had both author
and comments. It can now be written as:
</p>
<pre>
  for post in Post.find(:all, :limit =&gt; 100, :include =&gt; [ :author, :comments ])
</pre>
<p>
&#8230;and the number of database queries needed is now 1.
</p>
</li>
<li>Added new unified Base.find API and deprecated the use of find_first and
find_all. See the documentation for Base.find. Examples:

<pre>
  Person.find(1, :conditions =&gt; &quot;administrator = 1&quot;, :order =&gt; &quot;created_on DESC&quot;)
  Person.find(1, 5, 6, :conditions =&gt; &quot;administrator = 1&quot;, :order =&gt; &quot;created_on DESC&quot;)
  Person.find(:first, :order =&gt; &quot;created_on DESC&quot;, :offset =&gt; 5)
  Person.find(:all, :conditions =&gt; [ &quot;category IN (?)&quot;, categories], :limit =&gt; 50)
  Person.find(:all, :offset =&gt; 10, :limit =&gt; 10)
</pre>
</li>
<li>Added acts_as_nested_set 1000 [wschenk]. Introduction:

<pre>
  This acts provides Nested Set functionality.  Nested Set is similiar to Tree, but with
  the added feature that you can select the children and all of it's descendants with
  a single query.  A good use case for this is a threaded post system, where you want
  to display every reply to a comment without multiple selects.
</pre>
</li>
<li>Added Base.save! that attempts to save the record just like Base.save but
will raise a RecordInvalid exception instead of returning false if the
record is not valid [After much pestering from Dave Thomas]

</li>
<li>Fixed PostgreSQL usage of fixtures with regards to public schemas and table
names with dots 962 [gnuman1@gmail.com]

</li>
<li>Fixed that fixtures were being deleted in the same order as inserts causing
FK errors 890 [andrew.john.peters@gmail.com]

</li>
<li>Fixed loading of fixtures in to be in the right order (or PostgreSQL would
bark) 1047 [stephenh@chase3000.com]

</li>
<li>Fixed page caching for non-vhost applications living underneath the root
1004 [Ben Schumacher]

</li>
<li>Fixes a problem with the SQL Adapter which was resulting in IDENTITY_INSERT
not being set to ON when it should be 1104 [adelle]

</li>
<li>Added the option to specify the acceptance string in
validates_acceptance_of 1106 [caleb@aei-tech.com]

</li>
<li>Added insert_at(position) to acts_as_list 1083 [DeLynnB]

</li>
<li>Removed the default order by id on has_and_belongs_to_many queries as it
could kill performance on large sets (you can still specify by hand with
:order)

</li>
<li>Fixed that Base.silence should restore the old logger level when done, not
just set it to DEBUG 1084 [yon@milliped.com]

</li>
<li>Fixed boolean saving on Oracle 1093 [mparrish@pearware.org]

</li>
<li>Moved build_association and create_association for has_one and belongs_to
out of deprecation as they work when the association is nil unlike
association.build and association.create, which require the association to
be already in place 864

</li>
<li>Added rollbacks of transactions if they&#8216;re active as the dispatcher
is killed gracefully (TERM signal) 1054 [Leon Bredt]

</li>
<li>Added quoting of column names for fixtures 997 [jcfischer@gmail.com]

</li>
<li>Fixed counter_sql when no records exist in database for PostgreSQL (would
give error, not 0) 1039 [Caleb Tennis]

</li>
<li>Fixed that benchmarking times for rendering included db runtimes 987
[skaes@web.de]

</li>
<li>Fixed boolean queries for t/f fields in PostgreSQL 995
[dave@cherryville.org]

</li>
<li>Added that model.items.delete(child) will delete the child, not just set
the foreign key to nil, if the child is dependent on the model 978 [Jeremy
Kemper]

</li>
<li>Fixed auto-stamping of dates (created_on/updated_on) for PostgreSQL 985
[dave@cherryville.org]

</li>
<li>Fixed Base.silence/benchmark to only log if a logger has been configured
986 [skaes@web.de]

</li>
<li>Added a join parameter as the third argument to Base.find_first and as the
second to Base.count 426, 988 [skaes@web.de]

</li>
<li>Fixed bug in Base#hash method that would treat records with the same
string-based id as different [Dave Thomas]

</li>
<li>Renamed DateHelper#distance_of_time_in_words_to_now to
DateHelper#time_ago_in_words (old method name is still available as a
deprecated alias)

</li>
</ul>
<p>
*1.9.1* (27th March, 2005)
</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed that Active Record objects with float attribute could not be cloned
808

</li>
<li>Fixed that MissingSourceFile&#8216;s wasn&#8216;t properly detected in
production mode 925 [Nicholas Seckar]

</li>
<li>Fixed that :counter_cache option would look for a line_items_count column
for a LineItem object instead of lineitems_count

</li>
<li>Fixed that AR exists?() would explode on postgresql if the passed id did
not match the PK type 900 [Scott Barron]

</li>
<li>Fixed the MS SQL adapter to work with the new limit/offset approach and
with binary data (still suffering from 7KB limit, though) 901 [delynnb]

</li>
</ul>
<p>
*1.9.0* (22th March, 2005)
</p>
<ul>
<li>Added adapter independent limit clause as a two-element array with the
first being the limit, the second being the offset 795 [Sam Stephenson].
Example:

<pre>
  Developer.find_all nil, 'id ASC', 5      # return the first five developers
  Developer.find_all nil, 'id ASC', [3, 8] # return three developers, starting from #8 and forward
</pre>
<p>
This doesn&#8216;t yet work with the DB2 or MS SQL adapters. Patches to
make that happen are encouraged.
</p>
</li>
<li>Added alias_method :to_param, :id to Base, such that Active Record objects
to be used as URL parameters in Action Pack automatically 812 [Nicholas
Seckar/Sam Stephenson]

</li>
<li>Improved the performance of the OCI8 adapter for Oracle 723 [pilx/gjenkins]

</li>
<li>Added type conversion before saving a record, so string-based values like
&quot;10.0&quot; aren&#8216;t left for the database to convert 820
[dave@cherryville.org]

</li>
<li>Added with additional settings for working with transactional fixtures and
pre-loaded test databases 865 [mindel]

</li>
<li>Fixed acts_as_list to trigger remove_from_list on destroy after the fact,
not before, so a unique position can be maintained 871 [Alisdair McDiarmid]

</li>
<li>Added the possibility of specifying fixtures in multiple calls 816
[kim@tinker.com]

</li>
<li>Added Base.exists?(id) that&#8216;ll return true if an object of the class
with the given id exists 854 [stian@grytoyr.net]

</li>
<li>Added optionally allow for nil or empty strings with
validates_numericality_of 801 [Sebastian Kanthak]

</li>
<li>Fixed problem with using slashes in validates_format_of regular expressions
801 [Sebastian Kanthak]

</li>
<li>Fixed that SQLite3 exceptions are caught and reported properly 823 [yerejm]

</li>
<li>Added that all types of after_find/after_initialized callbacks are
triggered if the explicit implementation is present, not only the explicit
implementation itself

</li>
<li>Fixed that symbols can be used on attribute assignment, like
page.emails.create(:subject =&gt; data.subject, :body =&gt; data.body)

</li>
</ul>
<p>
*1.8.0* (7th March, 2005)
</p>
<ul>
<li>Added ActiveRecord::Base.colorize_logging to control whether to use colors
in logs or not (on by default)

</li>
<li>Added support for timestamp with time zone in PostgreSQL 560 [Scott Barron]

</li>
<li>Added MultiparameterAssignmentErrors and AttributeAssignmentError
exceptions 777 [demetrius]. Documentation:

<pre>
 * +MultiparameterAssignmentErrors+ -- collection of errors that occurred during a mass assignment using the
   +attributes=+ method. The +errors+ property of this exception contains an array of +AttributeAssignmentError+
   objects that should be inspected to determine which attributes triggered the errors.
 * +AttributeAssignmentError+ -- an error occurred while doing a mass assignment through the +attributes=+ method.
   You can inspect the +attribute+ property of the exception object to determine which attribute triggered the error.
</pre>
</li>
<li>Fixed that postgresql adapter would fails when reading bytea fields with
null value 771 [rodrigo k]

</li>
<li>Added transactional fixtures that uses rollback to undo changes to fixtures
instead of DELETE/INSERT &#8212; it&#8216;s much faster. See documentation
under <a href="../../../../classes/Fixtures.html">Fixtures</a> 760 [Jeremy
Kemper]

</li>
<li>Added destruction of dependent objects in has_one associations when a new
assignment happens 742 [mindel]. Example:

<pre>
  class Account &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
    has_one :credit_card, :dependent =&gt; true
  end
  class CreditCard &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
    belongs_to :account
  end

  account.credit_card # =&gt; returns existing credit card, lets say id = 12
  account.credit_card = CreditCard.create(&quot;number&quot; =&gt; &quot;123&quot;)
  account.save # =&gt; CC with id = 12 is destroyed
</pre>
</li>
<li>Added validates_numericality_of 716 [skanthak/c.r.mcgrath]. Docuemntation:

<pre>
  Validates whether the value of the specified attribute is numeric by trying to convert it to
  a float with Kernel.Float (if &lt;tt&gt;integer&lt;/tt&gt; is false) or applying it to the regular expression
  &lt;tt&gt;/^[\+\-]?\d+$/&lt;/tt&gt; (if &lt;tt&gt;integer&lt;/tt&gt; is set to true).

    class Person &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
      validates_numericality_of :value, :on =&gt; :create
    end

  Configuration options:
  * &lt;tt&gt;message&lt;/tt&gt; - A custom error message (default is: &quot;is not a number&quot;)
  * &lt;tt&gt;on&lt;/tt&gt; Specifies when this validation is active (default is :save, other options :create, :update)
  * &lt;tt&gt;only_integer&lt;/tt&gt; Specifies whether the value has to be an integer, e.g. an integral value (default is false)
</pre>
</li>
<li>Fixed that HasManyAssociation#count was using :finder_sql rather than
:counter_sql if it was available 445 [Scott Barron]

</li>
<li>Added better defaults for composed_of, so statements like composed_of
:time_zone, :mapping =&gt; %w( time_zone time_zone ) can be written without
the mapping part (it&#8216;s now assumed)

</li>
<li>Added MacroReflection#macro which will return a symbol describing the macro
used (like :composed_of or :has_many) 718, 248 [james@slashetc.com]

</li>
</ul>
<p>
*1.7.0* (24th February, 2005)
</p>
<ul>
<li>Changed the auto-timestamping feature to use
ActiveRecord::Base.default_timezone instead of entertaining the parallel
ActiveRecord::Base.timestamps_gmt method. The latter is now deprecated and
will throw a warning on use (but still work) 710 [Jamis Buck]

</li>
<li>Added a OCI8-based Oracle adapter that has been verified to work with
Oracle 8 and 9 629 [Graham Jenkins]. Usage notes:

<pre>
  1.  Key generation uses a sequence &quot;rails_sequence&quot; for all tables. (I couldn't find a simple
      and safe way of passing table-specific sequence information to the adapter.)
  2.  Oracle uses DATE or TIMESTAMP datatypes for both dates and times. Consequently I have had to
      resort to some hacks to get data converted to Date or Time in Ruby.
      If the column_name ends in _at (like created_at, updated_at) it's created as a Ruby Time. Else if the
      hours/minutes/seconds are 0, I make it a Ruby Date. Else it's a Ruby Time.
      This is nasty - but if you use Duck Typing you'll probably not care very much.
      In 9i it's tempting to map DATE to Date and TIMESTAMP to Time but I don't think that is
      valid - too many databases use DATE for both.
      Timezones and sub-second precision on timestamps are not supported.
  3.  Default values that are functions (such as &quot;SYSDATE&quot;) are not supported. This is a
      restriction of the way active record supports default values.
  4.  Referential integrity constraints are not fully supported. Under at least
      some circumstances, active record appears to delete parent and child records out of
      sequence and out of transaction scope. (Or this may just be a problem of test setup.)
</pre>
<p>
The OCI8 driver can be retrieved from <a
href="http://rubyforge.org/projects/ruby-oci8">rubyforge.org/projects/ruby-oci8</a>/
</p>
</li>
<li>Added option :schema_order to the PostgreSQL adapter to support the use of
multiple schemas per database 697 [YuriSchimke]

</li>
<li>Optimized the SQL used to generate has_and_belongs_to_many queries by
listing the join table first 693 [yerejm]

</li>
<li>Fixed that when using validation macros with a custom message, if you
happened to use single quotes in the message string you would get a parsing
error 657 [tonka]

</li>
<li>Fixed that Active Record would throw Broken Pipe errors with FCGI when the
MySQL connection timed out instead of reconnecting 428 [Nicholas Seckar]

</li>
<li>Added options to specify an SSL connection for MySQL. Define the following
attributes in the connection config (config/database.yml in <a
href="../../../../classes/Rails.html">Rails</a>) to use it: sslkey,
sslcert, sslca, sslcapath, sslcipher. To use SSL with no client certs, just
set :sslca = &#8217;/dev/null&#8217;. <a
href="http://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql/en/secure-connections.html">dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql/en/secure-connections.html</a>
604 [daniel@nightrunner.com]

</li>
<li>Added automatic dropping/creating of test tables for running the unit tests
on all databases 587 [adelle@bullet.net.au]

</li>
<li>Fixed that find_by_* would fail when column names had numbers 670
[demetrius]

</li>
<li>Fixed the SQL Server adapter on a bunch of issues 667 [DeLynn]

<pre>
  1. Created a new columns method that is much cleaner.
  2. Corrected a problem with the select and select_all methods
     that didn't account for the LIMIT clause being passed into raw SQL statements.
  3. Implemented the string_to_time method in order to create proper instances of the time class.
  4. Added logic to the simplified_type method that allows the database to specify the scale of float data.
  5. Adjusted the quote_column_name to account for the fact that MS SQL is bothered by a forward slash in the data string.
</pre>
</li>
<li>Fixed that the dynamic finder like find_all_by_something_boolean(false)
didn&#8216;t work 649 [lmarlow@yahoo.com]

</li>
<li>Added validates_each that validates each specified attribute against a
block 610 [Jeremy Kemper]. Example:

<pre>
  class Person &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
    validates_each :first_name, :last_name do |record, attr|
      record.errors.add attr, 'starts with z.' if attr[0] == ?z
    end
  end
</pre>
</li>
<li>Added :allow_nil as an explicit option for validates_length_of, so unless
that&#8216;s set to true having the attribute as nil will also return an
error if a range is specified as :within 610 [Jeremy Kemper]

</li>
<li>Added that validates_* now accept blocks to perform validations 618 [Tim
Bates]. Example:

<pre>
  class Person &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
    validate { |person| person.errors.add(&quot;title&quot;, &quot;will never be valid&quot;) if SHOULD_NEVER_BE_VALID }
  end
</pre>
</li>
<li>Addded validation for validate all the associated objects before declaring
failure with validates_associated 618 [Tim Bates]

</li>
<li>Added keyword-style approach to defining the custom relational bindings 545
[Jamis Buck]. Example:

<pre>
  class Project &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
    primary_key &quot;sysid&quot;
    table_name &quot;XYZ_PROJECT&quot;
    inheritance_column { original_inheritance_column + &quot;_id&quot; }
  end
</pre>
</li>
<li>Fixed Base#clone for use with PostgreSQL 565 [hanson@surgery.wisc.edu]

</li>
</ul>
<p>
*1.6.0* (January 25th, 2005)
</p>
<ul>
<li>Added that has_many association build and create methods can take arrays of
record data like Base#create and Base#build to build/create multiple
records at once.

</li>
<li>Added that Base#delete and Base#destroy both can take an array of ids to
delete/destroy 336

</li>
<li>Added the option of supplying an array of attributes to Base#create, so
that multiple records can be created at once.

</li>
<li>Added the option of supplying an array of ids and attributes to
Base#update, so that multiple records can be updated at once (inspired by
526/Duane Johnson). Example

<pre>
  people = { 1 =&gt; { &quot;first_name&quot; =&gt; &quot;David&quot; }, 2 =&gt; { &quot;first_name&quot; =&gt; &quot;Jeremy&quot;} }
  Person.update(people.keys, people.values)
</pre>
</li>
<li>Added ActiveRecord::Base.timestamps_gmt that can be set to true to make the
automated timestamping use GMT instead of local time 520 [Scott Baron]

</li>
<li>Added that update_all calls sanitize_sql on its updates argument, so stuff
like MyRecord.update_all([&#8216;time = ?&#8217;, Time.now]) works 519
[notahat]

</li>
<li>Fixed that the dynamic finders didn&#8216;t treat nil as a &quot;IS
NULL&quot; but rather &quot;= NULL&quot; case 515 [Demetrius]

</li>
<li>Added bind-named arrays for interpolating a group of ids or strings in
conditions 528 [Jeremy Kemper]

</li>
<li>Added that has_and_belongs_to_many associations with additional attributes
also can be created between unsaved objects and only committed to the
database when Base#save is called on the associator 524 [Eric Anderson]

</li>
<li>Fixed that records fetched with piggy-back attributes or through rich
has_and_belongs_to_many associations couldn&#8216;t be saved due to the
extra attributes not part of the table 522 [Eric Anderson]

</li>
<li>Added mass-assignment protection for the inheritance column &#8212;
regardless of a custom column is used or not

</li>
<li>Fixed that association proxies would fail === tests like
PremiumSubscription === @account.subscription

</li>
<li>Fixed that column aliases didn&#8216;t work as expected with the new
MySql411 driver 507 [Demetrius]

</li>
<li>Fixed that find_all would produce invalid sql when called sequentialy 490
[Scott Baron]

</li>
</ul>
<p>
*1.5.1* (January 18th, 2005)
</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed that the belongs_to and has_one proxy would fail a test like
&#8216;if project.manager&#8217; &#8212; this unfortunately also means that
you can&#8216;t call methods like project.manager.build unless there
already is a manager on the project 492 [Tim Bates]

</li>
<li>Fixed that the Ruby/MySQL adapter wouldn&#8216;t connect if the password
was empty 503 [Pelle]

</li>
</ul>
<p>
*1.5.0* (January 17th, 2005)
</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed that unit tests for MySQL are now run as the &quot;rails&quot; user
instead of root 455 [Eric Hodel]

</li>
<li>Added validates_associated that enables validation of objects in an unsaved
association 398 [Tim Bates]. Example:

<pre>
  class Book &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
    has_many :pages
    belongs_to :library

    validates_associated :pages, :library
  end
</pre>
</li>
<li>Added support for associating unsaved objects 402 [Tim Bates]. Rules that
govern this addition:

<pre>
  == Unsaved objects and associations

  You can manipulate objects and associations before they are saved to the database, but there is some special behaviour you should be
  aware of, mostly involving the saving of associated objects.

  === One-to-one associations

  * Assigning an object to a has_one association automatically saves that object, and the object being replaced (if there is one), in
    order to update their primary keys - except if the parent object is unsaved (new_record? == true).
  * If either of these saves fail (due to one of the objects being invalid) the assignment statement returns false and the assignment
    is cancelled.
  * If you wish to assign an object to a has_one association without saving it, use the #association.build method (documented below).
  * Assigning an object to a belongs_to association does not save the object, since the foreign key field belongs on the parent. It does
    not save the parent either.

  === Collections

  * Adding an object to a collection (has_many or has_and_belongs_to_many) automatically saves that object, except if the parent object
    (the owner of the collection) is not yet stored in the database.
  * If saving any of the objects being added to a collection (via #push or similar) fails, then #push returns false.
  * You can add an object to a collection without automatically saving it by using the #collection.build method (documented below).
  * All unsaved (new_record? == true) members of the collection are automatically saved when the parent is saved.
</pre>
</li>
<li>Added replace to associations, so you can do
project.manager.replace(new_manager) or
project.milestones.replace(new_milestones) 402 [Tim Bates]

</li>
<li>Added build and create methods to has_one and belongs_to associations, so
you can now do project.manager.build(attributes) 402 [Tim Bates]

</li>
<li>Added that if a before_* callback returns false, all the later callbacks
and the associated action are cancelled. If an after_* callback returns
false, all the later callbacks are cancelled. Callbacks are generally run
in the order they are defined, with the exception of callbacks defined as
methods on the model, which are called last. 402 [Tim Bates]

</li>
<li>Fixed that Base#== wouldn&#8216;t work for multiple references to the same
unsaved object 402 [Tim Bates]

</li>
<li>Fixed binary support for PostgreSQL 444 [alex@byzantine.no]

</li>
<li>Added a differenciation between AssociationCollection#size and -length. Now
AssociationCollection#size returns the size of the collection by executing
a SELECT COUNT(*) query if the collection hasn&#8216;t been loaded and
calling collection.size if it has. If it&#8216;s more likely than not that
the collection does have a size larger than zero and you need to fetch that
collection afterwards, it&#8216;ll take one less SELECT query if you use
length.

</li>
<li>Added Base#attributes that returns a hash of all the attributes with their
names as keys and clones of their objects as values 433 [atyp.de]

</li>
<li>Fixed that foreign keys named the same as the association would cause stack
overflow 437 [Eric Anderson]

</li>
<li>Fixed default scope of acts_as_list from &quot;1&quot; to &quot;1 =
1&quot;, so it&#8216;ll work in PostgreSQL (among other places) 427
[Alexey]

</li>
<li>Added Base#reload that reloads the attributes of an object from the
database 422 [Andreas Schwarz]

</li>
<li>Added SQLite3 compatibility through the sqlite3-ruby adapter by Jamis Buck
381 [Jeremy Kemper]

</li>
<li>Added support for the new protocol spoken by MySQL 4.1.1+ servers for the
Ruby/MySQL adapter that ships with <a
href="../../../../classes/Rails.html">Rails</a> 440 [Matt Mower]

</li>
<li>Added that Observers can use the observes class method instead of
overwriting self.observed_class().

<pre>
  Before:
    class ListSweeper &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
      def self.observed_class() [ List, Item ]
    end

  After:
    class ListSweeper &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
      observes List, Item
    end
</pre>
</li>
<li>Fixed that conditions in has_many and has_and_belongs_to_many should be
interpolated just like the finder_sql is

</li>
<li>Fixed Base#update_attribute to be indifferent to whether a string or symbol
is used to describe the name

</li>
<li>Added Base#toggle(attribute) and Base#toggle!(attribute) that makes it
easier to flip a switch or flag.

<pre>
  Before: topic.update_attribute(:approved, !approved?)
  After : topic.toggle!(:approved)
</pre>
</li>
<li>Added Base#increment!(attribute) and Base#decrement!(attribute) that also
saves the records. Example:

<pre>
  page.views # =&gt; 1
  page.increment!(:views) # executes an UPDATE statement
  page.views # =&gt; 2

  page.increment(:views).increment!(:views)
  page.views # =&gt; 4
</pre>
</li>
<li>Added Base#increment(attribute) and Base#decrement(attribute) that
encapsulates the += 1 and -= 1 patterns.

</li>
</ul>
<p>
*1.4.0* (January 4th, 2005)
</p>
<ul>
<li>Added automated optimistic locking if the field <tt>lock_version</tt> is
present. Each update to the record increments the lock_version column and
the locking facilities ensure that records instantiated twice will let the
last one saved raise a StaleObjectError if the first was also updated.
Example:

<pre>
  p1 = Person.find(1)
  p2 = Person.find(1)

  p1.first_name = &quot;Michael&quot;
  p1.save

  p2.first_name = &quot;should fail&quot;
  p2.save # Raises a ActiveRecord::StaleObjectError
</pre>
<p>
You&#8216;re then responsible for dealing with the conflict by rescuing the
exception and either rolling back, merging, or otherwise apply the business
logic needed to resolve the conflict.
</p>
<p>
384 [Michael Koziarski]
</p>
</li>
<li>Added dynamic attribute-based finders as a cleaner way of getting objects
by simple queries without turning to SQL. They work by appending the name
of an attribute to <tt>find_by_</tt>, so you get finders like
<tt>Person.find_by_user_name, Payment.find_by_transaction_id</tt>. So
instead of writing <tt>Person.find_first([&quot;user_name = ?&quot;,
user_name])</tt>, you just do <tt>Person.find_by_user_name(user_name)</tt>.

<p>
It&#8216;s also possible to use multiple attributes in the same find by
separating them with &quot;<em>and</em>&quot;, so you get finders like
<tt>Person.find_by_user_name_and_password</tt> or even
<tt>Payment.find_by_purchaser_and_state_and_country</tt>. So instead of
writing <tt>Person.find_first([&quot;user_name = ? AND password = ?&quot;,
user_name, password])</tt>, you just do
<tt>Person.find_by_user_name_and_password(user_name, password)</tt>.
</p>
<p>
While primarily a construct for easier find_firsts, it can also be used as
a construct for find_all by using calls like
<tt>Payment.find_all_by_amount(50)</tt> that is turned into
<tt>Payment.find_all([&quot;amount = ?&quot;, 50])</tt>. This is something
not as equally useful, though, as it&#8216;s not possible to specify the
order in which the objects are returned.
</p>
</li>
<li>Added block-style for callbacks 332 [Jeremy Kemper].

<pre>
  Before:
    before_destroy(Proc.new{ |record| Person.destroy_all &quot;firm_id = #{record.id}&quot; })

  After:
    before_destroy { |record| Person.destroy_all &quot;firm_id = #{record.id}&quot; }
</pre>
</li>
<li>Added :counter_cache option to acts_as_tree that works just like the one
you can define on belongs_to 371 [Josh]

</li>
<li>Added Base.default_timezone accessor that determines whether to use
Time.local (using :local) or Time.utc (using :utc) when pulling dates and
times from the database. This is set to :local by default.

</li>
<li>Added the possibility for adapters to overwrite add_limit! to implement a
different limiting scheme than &quot;LIMIT X&quot; used by MySQL,
PostgreSQL, and SQLite.

</li>
<li>Added the possibility of having objects with acts_as_list created before
their scope is available or&#8230;

</li>
<li>Added a db2 adapter that only depends on the Ruby/DB2 bindings (<a
href="http://raa.ruby-lang.org/project/ruby-db2">raa.ruby-lang.org/project/ruby-db2</a>/)
386 [Maik Schmidt]

</li>
<li>Added the final touches to the Microsoft SQL Server adapter by Joey Gibson
that makes it suitable for actual use 394 [DeLynn Barry]

</li>
<li>Added that Base#find takes an optional options hash, including :conditions.
Base#find_on_conditions deprecated in favor of find with :conditions 407
[Jeremy Kemper]

</li>
<li>Added HasManyAssociation#count that works like Base#count 413 [intinig]

</li>
<li>Fixed handling of binary content in blobs and similar fields for Ruby/MySQL
and SQLite 409 [xal]

</li>
<li>Fixed a bug in the Ruby/MySQL that caused binary content to be escaped
badly and come back mangled 405 [Tobias Luetke]

</li>
<li>Fixed that the const_missing autoload assumes the requested constant is set
by require_association and calls const_get to retrieve it. If
require_association did not set the constant then const_get will call
const_missing, resulting in an infinite loop 380 [Jeremy Kemper]

</li>
<li>Fixed broken transactions that were actually only running object-level and
not db level transactions [andreas]

</li>
<li>Fixed that validates_uniqueness_of used &#8216;id&#8217; instead of defined
primary key 406

</li>
<li>Fixed that the overwritten respond_to? method didn&#8216;t take two
parameters like the original 391

</li>
<li>Fixed quoting in validates_format_of that would allow some rules to pass
regardless of input 390 [Dmitry V. Sabanin]

</li>
</ul>
<p>
*1.3.0* (December 23, 2004)
</p>
<ul>
<li>Added a require_association hook on const_missing that makes it possible to
use any model class without requiring it first. This makes STI look like:

<pre>
  before:
    require_association 'person'
    class Employee &lt; Person
    end

  after:
    class Employee &lt; Person
    end
</pre>
<p>
This also reduces the usefulness of Controller.model in Action Pack to
currently only being for documentation purposes.
</p>
</li>
<li>Added that Base.update_all and Base.delete_all return an integer of the
number of affected rows 341

</li>
<li>Added scope option to validation_uniqueness 349 [Kent Sibilev]

</li>
<li>Added respondence to *_before_type_cast for all attributes to return their
string-state before they were type casted by the column type. This is
helpful for getting &quot;100,000&quot; back on a integer-based validation
where the value would normally be &quot;100&quot;.

</li>
<li>Added allow_nil options to validates_inclusion_of so that validation is
only triggered if the attribute is not nil [what-a-day]

</li>
<li>Added work-around for PostgreSQL and the problem of getting fixtures to be
created from id 1 on each test case. This only works for auto-incrementing
primary keys called &quot;id&quot; for now 359 [Scott Baron]

</li>
<li>Added Base#clear_association_cache to empty all the cached associations 347
[Tobias Luetke]

</li>
<li>Added more informative exceptions in establish_connection 356 [Jeremy
Kemper]

</li>
<li>Added Base#update_attributes that&#8216;ll accept a hash of attributes and
save the record (returning true if it passed validation, false otherwise).

<pre>
  Before:
    person.attributes = @params[&quot;person&quot;]
    person.save

  Now:
    person.update_attributes(@params[&quot;person&quot;])
</pre>
</li>
<li>Added Base.destroy and Base.delete to remove records without holding a
reference to them first.

</li>
<li>Added that query benchmarking will only happen if its going to be logged
anyway 344

</li>
<li>Added higher_item and lower_item as public methods for acts_as_list 342
[Tobias Luetke]

</li>
<li>Fixed that options[:counter_sql] was overwritten with interpolated sql
rather than original sql 355 [Jeremy Kemper]

</li>
<li>Fixed that overriding an attribute&#8216;s accessor would be disregarded by
add_on_empty and add_on_boundary_breaking because they simply used the
attributes[] hash instead of checking for @base.respond_to?(attr.to_s).
[Marten]

</li>
<li>Fixed that Base.table_name would expect a parameter when used in
has_and_belongs_to_many joins [Anna Lissa Cruz]

</li>
<li>Fixed that nested transactions now work by letting the outer most
transaction have the responsibilty of starting and rolling back the
transaction. If any of the inner transactions swallow the exception raised,
though, the transaction will not be rolled back. So always let the
transaction bubble up even when you&#8216;ve dealt with local issues.
Closes 231 and 340.

</li>
<li>Fixed validates_{confirmation,acceptance}_of to only happen when the
virtual attributes are not nil 348 [dpiddy@gmail.com]

</li>
<li>Changed the interface on AbstractAdapter to require that adapters return
the number of affected rows on delete and update operations.

</li>
<li>Fixed the automated timestamping feature when running under <a
href="../../../../classes/Rails.html">Rails</a>&#8217; development
environment that resets the inheritable attributes on each request.

</li>
</ul>
<p>
*1.2.0*
</p>
<ul>
<li>Added Base.validates_inclusion_of that validates whether the value of the
specified attribute is available in a particular enumerable object.
[what-a-day]

<pre>
  class Person &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
    validates_inclusion_of :gender, :in=&gt;%w( m f ), :message=&gt;&quot;woah! what are you then!??!!&quot;
    validates_inclusion_of :age, :in=&gt;0..99
  end
</pre>
</li>
<li>Added acts_as_list that can decorates an existing class with methods like
move_higher/lower, move_to_top/bottom. [Tobias Luetke] Example:

<pre>
  class TodoItem &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
    acts_as_list :scope =&gt; :todo_list_id
    belongs_to :todo_list
  end
</pre>
</li>
<li>Added acts_as_tree that can decorates an existing class with a many to many
relationship with itself. Perfect for categories in categories and the
likes. [Tobias Luetke]

</li>
<li>Added that Active Records will automatically record creation and/or update
timestamps of database objects if fields of the names created_at/created_on
or updated_at/updated_on are present. [Tobias Luetke]

</li>
<li>Added Base.default_error_messages as a hash of all the error messages used
in the validates_*_of so they can be changed in one place [Tobias Luetke]

</li>
<li>Added automatic transaction block around AssociationCollection.&lt;&lt;,
AssociationCollection.delete, and AssociationCollection.destroy_all

</li>
<li>Fixed that Base#find will return an array if given an array &#8212;
regardless of the number of elements 270 [Marten]

</li>
<li>Fixed that has_and_belongs_to_many would generate bad sql when naming
conventions differed from using vanilla &quot;id&quot; everywhere
[RedTerror]

</li>
<li>Added a better exception for when a type column is used in a table without
the intention of triggering single-table inheritance. Example:

<pre>
  ActiveRecord::SubclassNotFound: The single-table inheritance mechanism failed to locate the subclass: 'bad_class!'.
  This error is raised because the column 'type' is reserved for storing the class in case of inheritance.
  Please rename this column if you didn't intend it to be used for storing the inheritance class or
  overwrite Company.inheritance_column to use another column for that information.
</pre>
</li>
<li>Added that single-table inheritance will only kick in if the
inheritance_column (by default &quot;type&quot;) is present. Otherwise,
inheritance won&#8216;t have any magic side effects.

</li>
<li>Added the possibility of marking fields as being in error without adding a
message (using nil) to it that&#8216;ll get displayed wth full_messages 208
[mjobin]

</li>
<li>Fixed Base.errors to be indifferent as to whether strings or symbols are
used. Examples:

<pre>
  Before:
    errors.add(:name, &quot;must be shorter&quot;) if name.size &gt; 10
    errors.on(:name)  # =&gt; &quot;must be shorter&quot;
    errors.on(&quot;name&quot;) # =&gt; nil

  After:
    errors.add(:name, &quot;must be shorter&quot;) if name.size &gt; 10
    errors.on(:name)  # =&gt; &quot;must be shorter&quot;
    errors.on(&quot;name&quot;) # =&gt; &quot;must be shorter&quot;
</pre>
</li>
<li>Added Base.validates_format_of that Validates whether the value of the
specified attribute is of the correct form by matching it against the
regular expression provided. [Marcel]

<pre>
  class Person &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
    validates_format_of :email, :with =&gt; /^([^@\s]+)@((?:[-a-z0-9]+\.)+[a-z]{2,})$/, :on =&gt; :create
  end
</pre>
</li>
<li>Added Base.validates_length_of that delegates to add_on_boundary_breaking
312 [Tobias Luetke]. Example:

<pre>
  Validates that the specified attribute matches the length restrictions supplied in either:

    - configuration[:minimum]
    - configuration[:maximum]
    - configuration[:is]
    - configuration[:within] (aka. configuration[:in])

  Only one option can be used at a time.

    class Person &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
      validates_length_of :first_name, :maximum=&gt;30
      validates_length_of :last_name, :maximum=&gt;30, :message=&gt;&quot;less than %d if you don't mind&quot;
      validates_length_of :user_name, :within =&gt; 6..20, :too_long =&gt; &quot;pick a shorter name&quot;, :too_short =&gt; &quot;pick a longer name&quot;
      validates_length_of :fav_bra_size, :minimum=&gt;1, :too_short=&gt;&quot;please enter at least %d character&quot;
      validates_length_of :smurf_leader, :is=&gt;4, :message=&gt;&quot;papa is spelled with %d characters... don't play me.&quot;
    end
</pre>
</li>
<li>Added Base.validate_presence as an alternative to implementing validate and
doing errors.add_on_empty yourself.

</li>
<li>Added Base.validates_uniqueness_of that alidates whether the value of the
specified attributes are unique across the system. Useful for making sure
that only one user can be named &quot;davidhh&quot;.

<pre>
  class Person &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
    validates_uniqueness_of :user_name
  end
</pre>
<p>
When the record is created, a check is performed to make sure that no
record exist in the database with the given value for the specified
attribute (that maps to a column). When the record is updated, the same
check is made but disregarding the record itself.
</p>
</li>
<li>Added Base.validates_confirmation_of that encapsulates the pattern of
wanting to validate a password or email address field with a confirmation.
Example:

<pre>
   Model:
     class Person &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
       validates_confirmation_of :password
     end

   View:
     &lt;%= password_field &quot;person&quot;, &quot;password&quot; %&gt;
     &lt;%= password_field &quot;person&quot;, &quot;password_confirmation&quot; %&gt;

 The person has to already have a password attribute (a column in the people table), but the password_confirmation is virtual.
 It exists only as an in-memory variable for validating the password. This check is performed both on create and update.
</pre>
</li>
<li>Added Base.validates_acceptance_of that encapsulates the pattern of wanting
to validate the acceptance of a terms of service check box (or similar
agreement). Example:

<pre>
 class Person &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
   validates_acceptance_of :terms_of_service
 end
</pre>
<p>
The terms_of_service attribute is entirely virtual. No database column is
needed. This check is performed both on create and update.
</p>
<p>
NOTE: The agreement is considered valid if it&#8216;s set to the string
&quot;1&quot;. This makes it easy to relate it to an HTML checkbox.
</p>
</li>
<li>Added validation macros to make the stackable just like the lifecycle
callbacks. Examples:

<pre>
  class Person &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
    validate { |record| record.errors.add(&quot;name&quot;, &quot;too short&quot;) unless name.size &gt; 10 }
    validate { |record| record.errors.add(&quot;name&quot;, &quot;too long&quot;)  unless name.size &lt; 20 }
    validate_on_create :validate_password

    private
      def validate_password
        errors.add(&quot;password&quot;, &quot;too short&quot;) unless password.size &gt; 6
      end
  end
</pre>
</li>
<li>Added the option for sanitizing find_by_sql and the offset parts in regular
finds [Sam Stephenson]. Examples:

<pre>
  Project.find_all [&quot;category = ?&quot;, category_name], &quot;created ASC&quot;, [&quot;? OFFSET ?&quot;, 15, 20]
  Post.find_by_sql [&quot;SELECT * FROM posts WHERE author = ? AND created &gt; ?&quot;, author_id, start_date]
</pre>
</li>
<li>Fixed value quoting in all generated SQL statements, so that integers are
not surrounded in quotes and that all sanitation are happening through the
database&#8216;s own quoting routine. This should hopefully make it lots
easier for new adapters that doesn&#8216;t accept &#8216;1&#8217; for
integer columns.

</li>
<li>Fixed has_and_belongs_to_many guessing of foreign key so that keys are
generated correctly for models like SomeVerySpecialClient [Florian Weber]

</li>
<li>Added counter_sql option for has_many associations [Jeremy Kemper].
Documentation:

<pre>
  &lt;tt&gt;:counter_sql&lt;/tt&gt; - specify a complete SQL statement to fetch the size of the association. If +:finder_sql+ is
  specified but +:counter_sql+, +:counter_sql+ will be generated by replacing SELECT ... FROM with SELECT COUNT(*) FROM.
</pre>
</li>
<li>Fixed that methods wrapped in callbacks still return their original result
260 [Jeremy Kemper]

</li>
<li>Fixed the <a href="../../../../classes/Inflector.html">Inflector</a> to
handle the movie/movies pair correctly 261 [Scott Baron]

</li>
<li>Added named bind-style variable interpolation 281 [Michael Koziarski].
Example:

<pre>
  Person.find([&quot;id = :id and first_name = :first_name&quot;, { :id =&gt; 5, :first_name = &quot;bob' or 1=1&quot; }])
</pre>
</li>
<li>Added bind-style variable interpolation for the condition arrays that uses
the adapter&#8216;s quote method [Michael Koziarski]

<p>
Before:
</p>
<pre>
  find_first([ &quot;user_name = '%s' AND password = '%s'&quot;, user_name, password ])]
  find_first([ &quot;firm_id = %s&quot;, firm_id ])] # unsafe!
</pre>
<p>
After:
</p>
<pre>
  find_first([ &quot;user_name = ? AND password = ?&quot;, user_name, password ])]
  find_first([ &quot;firm_id = ?&quot;, firm_id ])]
</pre>
</li>
<li>Added CSV format for fixtures 272 [what-a-day]. (See the new and expanded
documentation on fixtures for more information)

</li>
<li>Fixed fixtures using primary key fields called something else than
&quot;id&quot; [dave]

</li>
<li>Added proper handling of time fields that are turned into Time objects with
the dummy date of 2000/1/1 [HariSeldon]

</li>
<li>Added reverse order of deleting fixtures, so referential keys can be
maintained 247 [Tim Bates]

</li>
<li>Added relative path search for sqlite dbfiles in database.yml (if
RAILS_ROOT is defined) 233 [Jeremy Kemper]

</li>
<li>Added option to establish_connection where you&#8216;ll be able to leave
out the parameter to have it use the RAILS_ENV environment variable

</li>
<li>Fixed problems with primary keys and postgresql sequences (230) [Tim Bates]

</li>
<li>Added reloading for associations under cached environments like FastCGI and
mod_ruby. This makes it possible to use those environments for development.
This is turned on by default, but can be turned off with
ActiveRecord::Base.reload_dependencies = false in production environments.

<p>
NOTE: This will only have an effect if you let the associations manage the
requiring of model classes. All libraries loaded through require will be
&quot;forever&quot; cached. You can, however, use
ActiveRecord::Base.load_or_require(&quot;library&quot;) to get this
behavior outside of the auto-loading associations.
</p>
</li>
<li>Added <a href="../../../../classes/ERB.html">ERB</a> capabilities to the
fixture files for dynamic fixture generation. You don&#8216;t need to do
anything, just include <a href="../../../../classes/ERB.html">ERB</a>
blocks like:

<pre>
  david:
    id: 1
    name: David

  jamis:
    id: 2
    name: Jamis

  &lt;% for digit in 3..10 %&gt;
  dev_&lt;%= digit %&gt;:
    id: &lt;%= digit %&gt;
    name: fixture_&lt;%= digit %&gt;
  &lt;% end %&gt;
</pre>
</li>
<li>Changed the yaml fixture searcher to look in the root of the fixtures
directory, so when you before could have something like:

<pre>
  fixtures/developers/fixtures.yaml
  fixtures/accounts/fixtures.yaml
</pre>
<p>
&#8230;you now need to do:
</p>
<pre>
  fixtures/developers.yaml
  fixtures/accounts.yaml
</pre>
</li>
<li>Changed the fixture format from:

<pre>
  name: david
  data:
   id: 1
   name: David Heinemeier Hansson
   birthday: 1979-10-15
   profession: Systems development
  ---
  name: steve
  data:
   id: 2
   name: Steve Ross Kellock
   birthday: 1974-09-27
   profession: guy with keyboard
</pre>
<p>
&#8230;to:
</p>
<pre>
  david:
   id: 1
   name: David Heinemeier Hansson
   birthday: 1979-10-15
   profession: Systems development

  steve:
   id: 2
   name: Steve Ross Kellock
   birthday: 1974-09-27
   profession: guy with keyboard
</pre>
<p>
The change is NOT backwards compatible. <a
href="../../../../classes/Fixtures.html">Fixtures</a> written in the old
YAML style needs to be rewritten!
</p>
</li>
<li>All associations will now attempt to require the classes that they
associate to. Relieving the need for most explicit &#8216;require&#8217;
statements.

</li>
</ul>
<p>
*1.1.0* (34)
</p>
<ul>
<li>Added automatic fixture setup and instance variable availability. <a
href="../../../../classes/Fixtures.html">Fixtures</a> can also be
automatically instantiated in instance variables relating to their names
using the following style:

<pre>
  class FixturesTest &lt; Test::Unit::TestCase
    fixtures :developers # you can add more with comma separation

    def test_developers
      assert_equal 3, @developers.size # the container for all the fixtures is automatically set
      assert_kind_of Developer, @david # works like @developers[&quot;david&quot;].find
      assert_equal &quot;David Heinemeier Hansson&quot;, @david.name
    end
  end
</pre>
</li>
<li>Added HasAndBelongsToManyAssociation#push_with_attributes(object,
join_attributes) that can create associations in the join table with
additional attributes. This is really useful when you have information
that&#8216;s only relevant to the join itself, such as a
&quot;added_on&quot; column for an association between post and category.
The added attributes will automatically be injected into objects retrieved
through the association similar to the piggy-back approach:

<pre>
  post.categories.push_with_attributes(category, :added_on =&gt; Date.today)
  post.categories.first.added_on # =&gt; Date.today
</pre>
<p>
NOTE: The categories table doesn&#8216;t have a added_on column, it&#8216;s
the categories_post join table that does!
</p>
</li>
<li>Fixed that :exclusively_dependent and :dependent can&#8216;t be activated
at the same time on has_many associations [Jeremy Kemper]

</li>
<li>Fixed that database passwords couldn&#8216;t be all numeric [Jeremy Kemper]

</li>
<li>Fixed that calling id would create the instance variable for new_records
preventing them from being saved correctly [Jeremy Kemper]

</li>
<li>Added sanitization feature to HasManyAssociation#find_all so it works just
like Base.find_all [Sam Stephenson/bitsweat]

</li>
<li>Added that you can pass overlapping ids to find without getting duplicated
records back [Jeremy Kemper]

</li>
<li>Added that Base.benchmark returns the result of the block [Jeremy Kemper]

</li>
<li>Fixed problem with unit tests on Windows with SQLite [paterno]

</li>
<li>Fixed that quotes would break regular non-yaml fixtures [Dmitry
Sabanin/daft]

</li>
<li>Fixed fixtures on windows with line endings cause problems under unix / mac
[Tobias Luetke]

</li>
<li>Added HasAndBelongsToManyAssociation#find(id) that&#8216;ll search inside
the collection and find the object or record with that id

</li>
<li>Added :conditions option to has_and_belongs_to_many that works just like
the one on all the other associations

</li>
<li>Added AssociationCollection#clear to remove all associations from has_many
and has_and_belongs_to_many associations without destroying the records
[geech]

</li>
<li>Added type-checking and remove in 1-instead-of-N sql statements to
AssociationCollection#delete [geech]

</li>
<li>Added a return of self to AssociationCollection#&lt;&lt; so appending can
be chained, like project &lt;&lt; Milestone.create &lt;&lt;
Milestone.create [geech]

</li>
<li>Added Base#hash and Base#eql? which means that all of the equality using
features of array and other containers now works:

<pre>
  [ Person.find(1), Person.find(2), Person.find(3) ] &amp; [ Person.find(1), Person.find(4) ] # =&gt; [ Person.find(1) ]
</pre>
</li>
<li>Added :uniq as an option to has_and_belongs_to_many which will
automatically ensure that AssociateCollection#uniq is called before pulling
records out of the association. This is especially useful for three-way
(and above) has_and_belongs_to_many associations.

</li>
<li>Added AssociateCollection#uniq which is especially useful for
has_and_belongs_to_many associations that can include duplicates, which is
common on associations that also use metadata. Usage: post.categories.uniq

</li>
<li>Fixed respond_to? to use a subclass specific hash instead of an Active
Record-wide one

</li>
<li>Fixed has_and_belongs_to_many to treat associations between classes in
modules properly [Florian Weber]

</li>
<li>Added a NoMethod exception to be raised when query and writer methods are
called for attributes that doesn&#8216;t exist [geech]

</li>
<li>Added a more robust version of <a
href="../../../../classes/Fixtures.html">Fixtures</a> that throws
meaningful errors when on formatting issues [geech]

</li>
<li>Added Base#transaction as a compliment to Base.transaction for prettier use
in instance methods [geech]

</li>
<li>Improved the speed of respond_to? by placing the dynamic methods lookup
table in a hash [geech]

</li>
<li>Added that any additional fields added to the join table in a
has_and_belongs_to_many association will be placed as attributes when
pulling records out through has_and_belongs_to_many associations. This is
helpful when have information about the association itself that you want
available on retrival.

</li>
<li>Added better loading exception catching and RubyGems retries to the
database adapters [alexeyv]

</li>
<li>Fixed bug with per-model transactions [daniel]

</li>
<li>Fixed Base#transaction so that it returns the result of the last expression
in the transaction block [alexeyv]

</li>
<li>Added Fixture#find to find the record corresponding to the fixture id. The
record class name is guessed by using <a
href="../../../../classes/Inflector.html#M001940">Inflector#classify</a>
(also new) on the fixture directory name.

<pre>
  Before: Document.find(@documents[&quot;first&quot;][&quot;id&quot;])
  After : @documents[&quot;first&quot;].find
</pre>
</li>
<li>Fixed that the table name part of column names (&quot;TABLE.COLUMN&quot;)
wasn&#8216;t removed properly [Andreas Schwarz]

</li>
<li>Fixed a bug with Base#size when a finder_sql was used that didn&#8216;t
capitalize SELECT and FROM [geech]

</li>
<li>Fixed quoting problems on SQLite by adding quote_string to the
AbstractAdapter that can be overwritten by the concrete adapters for a call
to the dbm. [Andreas Schwarz]

</li>
<li>Removed RubyGems backup strategy for requiring SQLite-adapter &#8212; if
people want to use gems, they&#8216;re already doing it with AR.

</li>
</ul>
<p>
*1.0.0 (35)*
</p>
<ul>
<li>Added OO-style associations methods [Florian Weber]. Examples:

<pre>
  Project#milestones_count       =&gt; Project#milestones.size
  Project#build_to_milestones    =&gt; Project#milestones.build
  Project#create_for_milestones  =&gt; Project#milestones.create
  Project#find_in_milestones     =&gt; Project#milestones.find
  Project#find_all_in_milestones =&gt; Project#milestones.find_all
</pre>
</li>
<li>Added serialize as a new class method to control when text attributes
should be YAMLized or not. This means that automated serialization of
hashes, arrays, and so on WILL NO LONGER HAPPEN (10). You need to do
something like this:

<pre>
  class User &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
    serialize :settings
  end
</pre>
<p>
This will assume that settings is a text column and will now YAMLize any
object put in that attribute. You can also specify an optional :class_name
option that&#8216;ll raise an exception if a serialized object is retrieved
as a descendent of a class not in the hierarchy. Example:
</p>
<pre>
  class User &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
    serialize :settings, :class_name =&gt; &quot;Hash&quot;
  end

  user = User.create(&quot;settings&quot; =&gt; %w( one two three ))
  User.find(user.id).settings # =&gt; raises SerializationTypeMismatch
</pre>
</li>
<li>Added the option to connect to a different database for one model at a
time. Just call establish_connection on the class you want to have
connected to another database than Base. This will automatically also
connect decendents of that class to the different database [Renald Buter].

</li>
<li>Added transactional protection for Base#save. Validations can now check for
values knowing that it happens in a transaction and callbacks can raise
exceptions knowing that the save will be rolled back. [Suggested by Alexey
Verkhovsky]

</li>
<li>Added column name quoting so reserved words, such as
&quot;references&quot;, can be used as column names [Ryan Platte]

</li>
<li>Added the possibility to chain the return of what happened inside a logged
block [geech]:

<pre>
  This now works:
    log { ... }.map { ... }

  Instead of doing:
    result = []
    log { result = ... }
    result.map { ... }
</pre>
</li>
<li>Added &quot;socket&quot; option for the MySQL adapter, so you can change it
to something else than &quot;/tmp/mysql.sock&quot; [Anna Lissa Cruz]

</li>
<li>Added respond_to? answers for all the attribute methods. So if Person has a
name attribute retrieved from the table schema, person.respond_to?
&quot;name&quot; will return true.

</li>
<li>Added Base.benchmark which can be used to aggregate logging and benchmark,
so you can measure and represent multiple statements in a single block.
Usage (hides all the SQL calls for the individual actions and calculates
total runtime for them all):

<pre>
  Project.benchmark(&quot;Creating project&quot;) do
    project = Project.create(&quot;name&quot; =&gt; &quot;stuff&quot;)
    project.create_manager(&quot;name&quot; =&gt; &quot;David&quot;)
    project.milestones &lt;&lt; Milestone.find_all
  end
</pre>
</li>
<li>Added logging of invalid SQL statements [Suggested by Daniel Von Fange]

</li>
<li>Added alias Errors#[] for Errors#on, so you can now say
person.errors[&quot;name&quot;] to retrieve the errors for name [Andreas
Schwarz]

</li>
<li>Added RubyGems require attempt if sqlite-ruby is not available through
regular methods.

</li>
<li>Added compatibility with 2.x series of sqlite-ruby drivers. [Jamis Buck]

</li>
<li>Added type safety for association assignments, so a <a
href="../../../../classes/ActiveRecord/AssociationTypeMismatch.html">ActiveRecord::AssociationTypeMismatch</a>
will be raised if you attempt to assign an object that&#8216;s not of the
associated class. This cures the problem with nil giving id = 4 and fixnums
giving id = 1 on mistaken association assignments. [Reported by Andreas
Schwarz]

</li>
<li>Added the option to keep many fixtures in one single YAML document
[what-a-day]

</li>
<li>Added the class method &quot;inheritance_column&quot; that can be
overwritten to return the name of an alternative column than
&quot;type&quot; for storing the type for inheritance hierarchies. [Dave
Steinberg]

</li>
<li>Added [] and []= as an alternative way to access attributes when the
regular methods have been overwritten [Dave Steinberg]

</li>
<li>Added the option to observer more than one class at the time by specifying
observed_class as an array

</li>
<li>Added auto-id propagation support for tables with arbitrary primary keys
that have autogenerated sequences associated with them on PostgreSQL. [Dave
Steinberg]

</li>
<li>Changed that integer and floats set to &quot;&quot; through attributes=
remain as NULL. This was especially a problem for scaffolding and
postgresql. (49)

</li>
<li>Changed the MySQL Adapter to rely on MySQL for its defaults for socket,
host, and port [Andreas Schwarz]

</li>
<li>Changed ActionControllerError to decent from StandardError instead of
Exception. It can now be caught by a generic rescue.

</li>
<li>Changed class inheritable attributes to not use eval [Caio Chassot]

</li>
<li>Changed Errors#add to now use &quot;invalid&quot; as the default message
instead of true, which means full_messages work with those [Marcel Molina
Jr]

</li>
<li>Fixed spelling on Base#add_on_boundry_breaking to
Base#add_on_boundary_breaking (old naming still works) [Marcel Molina Jr.]

</li>
<li>Fixed that entries in the has_and_belongs_to_many join table didn&#8216;t
get removed when an associated object was destroyed.

</li>
<li>Fixed unnecessary calls to SET AUTOCOMMIT=0/1 for MySQL adapter [Andreas
Schwarz]

</li>
<li>Fixed PostgreSQL defaults are now handled gracefully [Dave Steinberg]

</li>
<li>Fixed increment/decrement_counter are now atomic updates [Andreas Schwarz]

</li>
<li>Fixed the problems the <a
href="../../../../classes/Inflector.html">Inflector</a> had turning
Attachment into attuchments and Cases into Casis [radsaq/Florian Gross]

</li>
<li>Fixed that cloned records would point attribute references on the parent
object [Andreas Schwarz]

</li>
<li>Fixed SQL for type call on inheritance hierarchies [Caio Chassot]

</li>
<li>Fixed bug with typed inheritance [Florian Weber]

</li>
<li>Fixed a bug where has_many collection_count wouldn&#8216;t use the
conditions specified for that association

</li>
</ul>
<p>
*0.9.5*
</p>
<ul>
<li>Expanded the table_name guessing rules immensely [Florian Green].
Documentation:

<pre>
  Guesses the table name (in forced lower-case) based on the name of the class in the inheritance hierarchy descending
  directly from ActiveRecord. So if the hierarchy looks like: Reply &lt; Message &lt; ActiveRecord, then Message is used
  to guess the table name from even when called on Reply. The guessing rules are as follows:
  * Class name ends in &quot;x&quot;, &quot;ch&quot; or &quot;ss&quot;: &quot;es&quot; is appended, so a Search class becomes a searches table.
  * Class name ends in &quot;y&quot; preceded by a consonant or &quot;qu&quot;: The &quot;y&quot; is replaced with &quot;ies&quot;,
    so a Category class becomes a categories table.
  * Class name ends in &quot;fe&quot;: The &quot;fe&quot; is replaced with &quot;ves&quot;, so a Wife class becomes a wives table.
  * Class name ends in &quot;lf&quot; or &quot;rf&quot;: The &quot;f&quot; is replaced with &quot;ves&quot;, so a Half class becomes a halves table.
  * Class name ends in &quot;person&quot;: The &quot;person&quot; is replaced with &quot;people&quot;, so a Salesperson class becomes a salespeople table.
  * Class name ends in &quot;man&quot;: The &quot;man&quot; is replaced with &quot;men&quot;, so a Spokesman class becomes a spokesmen table.
  * Class name ends in &quot;sis&quot;: The &quot;i&quot; is replaced with an &quot;e&quot;, so a Basis class becomes a bases table.
  * Class name ends in &quot;tum&quot; or &quot;ium&quot;: The &quot;um&quot; is replaced with an &quot;a&quot;, so a Datum class becomes a data table.
  * Class name ends in &quot;child&quot;: The &quot;child&quot; is replaced with &quot;children&quot;, so a NodeChild class becomes a node_children table.
  * Class name ends in an &quot;s&quot;: No additional characters are added or removed.
  * Class name doesn't end in &quot;s&quot;: An &quot;s&quot; is appended, so a Comment class becomes a comments table.
  * Class name with word compositions: Compositions are underscored, so CreditCard class becomes a credit_cards table.
  Additionally, the class-level table_name_prefix is prepended to the table_name and the table_name_suffix is appended.
  So if you have &quot;myapp_&quot; as a prefix, the table name guess for an Account class becomes &quot;myapp_accounts&quot;.

  You can also overwrite this class method to allow for unguessable links, such as a Mouse class with a link to a
  &quot;mice&quot; table. Example:

    class Mouse &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
       def self.table_name() &quot;mice&quot; end
    end
</pre>
<p>
This conversion is now done through an external class called <a
href="../../../../classes/Inflector.html">Inflector</a> residing in
lib/active_record/support/inflector.rb.
</p>
</li>
<li>Added find_all_in_collection to has_many defined collections. Works like
this:

<pre>
  class Firm &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
    has_many :clients
  end

  firm.id # =&gt; 1
  firm.find_all_in_clients &quot;revenue &gt; 1000&quot; # SELECT * FROM clients WHERE firm_id = 1 AND revenue &gt; 1000
</pre>
<p>
[Requested by Dave Thomas]
</p>
</li>
<li>Fixed finders for inheritance hierarchies deeper than one level [Florian
Weber]

</li>
<li>Added add_on_boundry_breaking to errors to accompany add_on_empty as a
default validation method. It&#8216;s used like this:

<pre>
  class Person &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
    protected
      def validation
        errors.add_on_boundry_breaking &quot;password&quot;, 3..20
      end
  end
</pre>
<p>
This will add an error to the tune of &quot;is too short (minimum is 3
characters)&quot; or &quot;is too long (minimum is 20 characters)&quot; if
the password is outside the boundry. The messages can be changed by passing
a third and forth parameter as message strings.
</p>
</li>
<li>Implemented a clone method that works properly with AR. It returns a clone
of the record that hasn&#8216;t been assigned an id yet and is treated as a
new record.

</li>
<li>Allow for domain sockets in PostgreSQL by not assuming localhost when no
host is specified [Scott Barron]

</li>
<li>Fixed that bignums are saved properly instead of attempted to be YAMLized
[Andreas Schwartz]

</li>
<li>Fixed a bug in the GEM where the rdoc options weren&#8216;t being passed
according to spec [Chad Fowler]

</li>
<li>Fixed a bug with the exclusively_dependent option for has_many

</li>
</ul>
<p>
*0.9.4*
</p>
<ul>
<li>Correctly guesses the primary key when the class is inside a module [Dave
Steinberg].

</li>
<li>Added [] and []= as alternatives to read_attribute and write_attribute
[Dave Steinberg]

</li>
<li>has_and_belongs_to_many now accepts an :order key to determine in which
order the collection is returned [radsaq].

</li>
<li>The ids passed to find and find_on_conditions are now automatically
sanitized.

</li>
<li>Added escaping of plings in YAML content.

</li>
<li>Multi-parameter assigns where all the parameters are empty will now be set
to nil instead of a new instance of their class.

</li>
<li>Proper type within an inheritance hierarchy is now ensured already at
object initialization (instead of first at create)

</li>
</ul>
<p>
*0.9.3*
</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed bug with using a different primary key name together with
has_and_belongs_to_many [Investigation by Scott]

</li>
<li>Added :exclusively_dependent option to the has_many association macro. The
doc reads:

<pre>
  If set to true all the associated object are deleted in one SQL statement without having their
  before_destroy callback run. This should only be used on associations that depend solely on
  this class and don't need to do any clean-up in before_destroy. The upside is that it's much
  faster, especially if there's a counter_cache involved.
</pre>
</li>
<li>Added :port key to connection options, so the PostgreSQL and MySQL adapters
can connect to a database server running on another port than the default.

</li>
<li>Converted the new natural singleton methods that prevented AR objects from
being saved by PStore (and hence be placed in a <a
href="../../../../classes/Rails.html">Rails</a> session) to a module.
[Florian Weber]

</li>
<li>Fixed the use of floats (was broken since 0.9.0+)

</li>
<li>Fixed PostgreSQL adapter so default values are displayed properly when used
in conjunction with Action Pack scaffolding.

</li>
<li>Fixed booleans support for PostgreSQL (use real true/false¬†on boolean
fields instead of 0/1 on tinyints) [radsaq]

</li>
</ul>
<p>
*0.9.2*
</p>
<ul>
<li>Added static method for instantly updating a record

</li>
<li>Treat decimal and numeric as Ruby floats [Andreas Schwartz]

</li>
<li>Treat chars as Ruby strings (fixes problem for Action Pack form helpers
too)

</li>
<li>Removed debugging output accidently left in (which would screw web
applications)

</li>
</ul>
<p>
*0.9.1*
</p>
<ul>
<li>Added MIT license

</li>
<li>Added natural object-style assignment for has_and_belongs_to_many
associations. Consider the following model:

<pre>
  class Event &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
    has_one_and_belongs_to_many :sponsors
  end

  class Sponsor &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
    has_one_and_belongs_to_many :sponsors
  end
</pre>
<p>
Earlier, you&#8216;d have to use synthetic methods for creating
associations between two objects of the above class:
</p>
<pre>
  roskilde_festival.add_to_sponsors(carlsberg)
  roskilde_festival.remove_from_sponsors(carlsberg)

  nike.add_to_events(world_cup)
  nike.remove_from_events(world_cup)
</pre>
<p>
Now you can use regular array-styled methods:
</p>
<pre>
  roskilde_festival.sponsors &lt;&lt; carlsberg
  roskilde_festival.sponsors.delete(carlsberg)

  nike.events &lt;&lt; world_cup
  nike.events.delete(world_cup)
</pre>
</li>
<li>Added delete method for has_many associations. Using this will nullify an
association between the has_many and the belonging object by setting the
foreign key to null. Consider this model:

<pre>
  class Post &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
    has_many :comments
  end

  class Comment &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
    belongs_to :post
  end
</pre>
<p>
You could do something like:
</p>
<pre>
  funny_comment.has_post? # =&gt; true
  announcement.comments.delete(funny_comment)
  funny_comment.has_post? # =&gt; false
</pre>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
*0.9.0*
</p>
<ul>
<li>Active Record is now thread safe! (So you can use it with Cerise and
WEBrick applications) [Implementation idea by Michael Neumann, debugging
assistance by Jamis Buck]

</li>
<li>Improved performance by roughly 400% on a basic test case of pulling 100
records and querying one attribute. This brings the tax for using Active
Record instead of &quot;riding on the metal&quot; (using MySQL-ruby
C-driver directly) down to ~50%. Done by doing lazy type conversions and
caching column information on the class-level.

</li>
<li>Added callback objects and procs as options for implementing the target for
callback macros.

</li>
<li>Added &quot;counter_cache&quot; option to belongs_to that automates the
usage of increment_counter and decrement_counter. Consider:

<pre>
  class Post &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
    has_many :comments
  end

  class Comment &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
    belongs_to :post
  end
</pre>
<p>
Iterating over 100 posts like this:
</p>
<pre>
  &lt;% for post in @posts %&gt;
    &lt;%= post.title %&gt; has &lt;%= post.comments_count %&gt; comments
  &lt;% end %&gt;
</pre>
<p>
Will generate 100 SQL count queries &#8212; one for each call to
post.comments_count. If you instead add a &quot;comments_count&quot; int
column to the posts table and rewrite the comments association macro with:
</p>
<pre>
  class Comment &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
    belongs_to :post, :counter_cache =&gt; true
  end
</pre>
<p>
Those 100 SQL count queries will be reduced to zero. Beware that counter
caching is only appropriate for objects that begin life with the object
it&#8216;s specified to belong with and is destroyed like that as well.
Typically objects where you would also specify :dependent =&gt; true. If
your objects switch from one belonging to another (like a post that can be
move from one category to another), you&#8216;ll have to manage the counter
yourself.
</p>
</li>
<li>Added natural object-style assignment for has_one and belongs_to
associations. Consider the following model:

<pre>
  class Project &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
    has_one :manager
  end

  class Manager &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
    belongs_to :project
  end
</pre>
<p>
Earlier, assignments would work like following regardless of which way the
assignment told the best story:
</p>
<pre>
  active_record.manager_id = david.id
</pre>
<p>
Now you can do it either from the belonging side:
</p>
<pre>
  david.project = active_record
</pre>
<p>
&#8230;or from the having side:
</p>
<pre>
  active_record.manager = david
</pre>
<p>
If the assignment happens from the having side, the assigned object is
automatically saved. So in the example above, the project_id attribute on
david would be set to the id of active_record, then david would be saved.
</p>
</li>
<li>Added natural object-style assignment for has_many associations [Florian
Weber]. Consider the following model:

<pre>
  class Project &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
    has_many :milestones
  end

  class Milestone &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
    belongs_to :project
  end
</pre>
<p>
Earlier, assignments would work like following regardless of which way the
assignment told the best story:
</p>
<pre>
  deadline.project_id = active_record.id
</pre>
<p>
Now you can do it either from the belonging side:
</p>
<pre>
  deadline.project = active_record
</pre>
<p>
&#8230;or from the having side:
</p>
<pre>
  active_record.milestones &lt;&lt; deadline
</pre>
<p>
The milestone is automatically saved with the new foreign key.
</p>
</li>
<li>API CHANGE: Attributes for text (or blob or similar) columns will now have
unknown classes stored using YAML instead of using to_s. (Known classes
that won&#8216;t be yamelized are: String, NilClass, TrueClass, FalseClass,
<a href="../../../../classes/Fixnum.html">Fixnum</a>, Date, and Time).
Likewise, data pulled out of text-based attributes will be attempted
converged using Yaml if they have the &quot;&#8212; &quot; header. This was
primarily done to be enable the storage of hashes and arrays without
wrapping them in aggregations, so now you can do:

<pre>
  user = User.find(1)
  user.preferences = { &quot;background&quot; =&gt; &quot;black&quot;, &quot;display&quot; =&gt; large }
  user.save

  User.find(1).preferences # =&gt; { &quot;background&quot; =&gt; &quot;black&quot;, &quot;display&quot; =&gt; large }
</pre>
<p>
Please note that this method should only be used when you don&#8216;t care
about representing the object in proper columns in the database. A money
object consisting of an amount and a currency is still a much better fit
for a value object done through aggregations than this new option.
</p>
</li>
<li>POSSIBLE CODE BREAKAGE: As a consequence of the lazy type conversions,
it&#8216;s a bad idea to reference the @attributes hash directly (it always
was, but now it&#8216;s paramount that you don&#8216;t). If you do, you
won&#8216;t get the type conversion. So to implement new accessors for
existing attributes, use read_attribute(attr_name) and
write_attribute(attr_name, value) instead. Like this:

<pre>
  class Song &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
    # Uses an integer of seconds to hold the length of the song

    def length=(minutes)
      write_attribute(&quot;length&quot;, minutes * 60)
    end

    def length
      read_attribute(&quot;length&quot;) / 60
    end
  end
</pre>
<p>
The clever kid will notice that this opens a door to sidestep the automated
type conversion by using @attributes directly. This is not recommended as
read/write_attribute may be granted additional responsibilities in the
future, but if you think you know what you&#8216;re doing and aren&#8216;t
afraid of future consequences, this is an option.
</p>
</li>
<li>Applied a few minor bug fixes reported by Daniel Von Fange.

</li>
</ul>
<p>
*0.8.4*
</p>
<p>
<em>Reflection</em>
</p>
<ul>
<li>Added ActiveRecord::Reflection with a bunch of methods and classes for
reflecting in aggregations and associations.

</li>
<li>Added Base.columns and Base.content_columns which returns arrays of column
description (type, default, etc) objects.

</li>
<li>Added Base#attribute_names which returns an array of names for the
attributes available on the object.

</li>
<li>Added Base#column_for_attribute(name) which returns the column description
object for the named attribute.

</li>
</ul>
<p>
<em>Misc</em>
</p>
<ul>
<li>Added multi-parameter assignment:

<pre>
  # Instantiate objects for all attribute classes that needs more than one constructor parameter. This is done
  # by calling new on the column type or aggregation type (through composed_of) object with these parameters.
  # So having the pairs written_on(1) = &quot;2004&quot;, written_on(2) = &quot;6&quot;, written_on(3) = &quot;24&quot;, will instantiate
  # written_on (a date type) with Date.new(&quot;2004&quot;, &quot;6&quot;, &quot;24&quot;). You can also specify a typecast character in the
  # parenteses to have the parameters typecasted before they're used in the constructor. Use i for Fixnum, f for Float,
  # s for String, and a for Array.
</pre>
<p>
This is incredibly useful for assigning dates from HTML drop-downs of
month, year, and day.
</p>
</li>
<li>Fixed bug with custom primary key column name and Base.find on multiple
parameters.

</li>
<li>Fixed bug with dependent option on has_one associations if there was no
associated object.

</li>
</ul>
<p>
*0.8.3*
</p>
<p>
<em>Transactions</em>
</p>
<ul>
<li>Added transactional protection for destroy (important for the new
:dependent option) [Suggested by Carl Youngblood]

</li>
<li>Fixed so transactions are ignored on MyISAM tables for MySQL (use InnoDB to
get transactions)

</li>
<li>Changed transactions so only exceptions will cause a rollback, not returned
false.

</li>
</ul>
<p>
<em>Mapping</em>
</p>
<ul>
<li>Added support for non-integer primary keys [Aredridel/earlier work by
Michael Neumann]

<pre>
  User.find &quot;jdoe&quot;
  Product.find &quot;PDKEY-INT-12&quot;
</pre>
</li>
<li>Added option to specify naming method for primary key column.
ActiveRecord::Base.primary_key_prefix_type can either be set to nil,
:table_name, or :table_name_with_underscore. :table_name will assume that
Product class has a primary key of &quot;productid&quot; and
:table_name_with_underscore will assume &quot;product_id&quot;. The default
nil will just give &quot;id&quot;.

</li>
<li>Added an overwriteable primary_key method that&#8216;ll instruct AR to the
name of the id column [Aredridele/earlier work by Guan Yang]

<pre>
  class Project &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
    def self.primary_key() &quot;project_id&quot; end
  end
</pre>
</li>
<li>Fixed that Active Records can safely associate inside and out of modules.

<pre>
  class MyApplication::Account &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
    has_many :clients # will look for MyApplication::Client
    has_many :interests, :class_name =&gt; &quot;Business::Interest&quot; # will look for Business::Interest
  end
</pre>
</li>
<li>Fixed that Active Records can safely live inside modules [Aredridel]

<pre>
  class MyApplication::Account &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
  end
</pre>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
<em>Misc</em>
</p>
<ul>
<li>Added freeze call to value object assignments to ensure they remain
immutable [Spotted by Gavin Sinclair]

</li>
<li>Changed interface for specifying observed class in observers. Was
OBSERVED_CLASS constant, now is observed_class() class method. This is more
consistant with things like self.table_name(). Works like this:

<pre>
  class AuditObserver &lt; ActiveRecord::Observer
    def self.observed_class() Account end
    def after_update(account)
      AuditTrail.new(account, &quot;UPDATED&quot;)
    end
  end
</pre>
<p>
[Suggested by Gavin Sinclair]
</p>
</li>
<li>Create new Active Record objects by setting the attributes through a block.
Like this:

<pre>
  person = Person.new do |p|
    p.name = 'Freddy'
    p.age  = 19
  end
</pre>
<p>
[Suggested by Gavin Sinclair]
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
*0.8.2*
</p>
<ul>
<li>Added inheritable callback queues that can ensure that certain callback
methods or inline fragments are run throughout the entire inheritance
hierarchy. Regardless of whether a descendent overwrites the callback
method:

<pre>
  class Topic &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
    before_destroy :destroy_author, 'puts &quot;I'm an inline fragment&quot;'
  end
</pre>
<p>
Learn more in <a
href="../../../../classes/ActiveRecord/Callbacks.html">classes/ActiveRecord/Callbacks.html</a>
</p>
</li>
<li>Added :dependent option to has_many and has_one, which will automatically
destroy associated objects when the holder is destroyed:

<pre>
  class Album &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
    has_many :tracks, :dependent =&gt; true
  end
</pre>
<p>
All the associated tracks are destroyed when the album is.
</p>
</li>
<li>Added Base.create as a factory that&#8216;ll create, save, and return a new
object in one step.

</li>
<li>Automatically convert strings in config hashes to symbols for the
_connection methods. This allows you to pass the argument hashes directly
from yaml. (Luke)

</li>
<li>Fixed the install.rb to include simple.rb [Spotted by Kevin Bullock]

</li>
<li>Modified block syntax to better follow our code standards outlined in <a
href="http://www.rubyonrails.org/CodingStandards">www.rubyonrails.org/CodingStandards</a>

</li>
</ul>
<p>
*0.8.1*
</p>
<ul>
<li>Added object-level transactions [Thanks to Austin Ziegler for
Transaction::Simple]

</li>
<li>Changed adapter-specific connection methods to use centralized
ActiveRecord::Base.establish_connection, which is parametized through a
config hash with symbol keys instead of a regular parameter list. This will
allow for database connections to be opened in a more generic fashion.
(Luke)

<p>
NOTE: This requires all *_connections to be updated! Read more in: <a
href="http://ar.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveRecord/Base.html#M000081">ar.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveRecord/Base.html#M000081</a>
</p>
</li>
<li>Fixed SQLite adapter so objects fetched from has_and_belongs_to_many have
proper attributes (t.name is now name). [Spotted by Garrett Rooney]

</li>
<li>Fixed SQLite adapter so dates are returned as Date objects, not Time
objects [Spotted by Gavin Sinclair]

</li>
<li>Fixed requirement of date class, so date conversions are succesful
regardless of whether you manually require date or not.

</li>
</ul>
<p>
*0.8.0*
</p>
<ul>
<li>Added transactions

</li>
<li>Changed Base.find to also accept either a list (1, 5, 6) or an array of ids
([5, 7]) as parameter and then return an array of objects instead of just
an object

</li>
<li>Fixed method has_collection? for has_and_belongs_to_many macro to behave as
a collection, not an association

</li>
<li>Fixed SQLite adapter so empty or nil values in columns of datetime, date,
or time type aren&#8216;t treated as current time [Spotted by Gavin
Sinclair]

</li>
</ul>
<p>
*0.7.6*
</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed the install.rb to create the lib/active_record/support directory
[Spotted by Gavin Sinclair]

</li>
<li>Fixed that has_association? would always return true [Spotted by Daniel Von
Fange]
