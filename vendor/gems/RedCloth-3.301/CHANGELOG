= RedCloth 4.0
=== 15th Feb, 2007

* New SuperRedCloth (RedCloth 4.0) is a total rewrite using Ragel for the parsing.
* The restrictions parameter is accepted for backward compatibility, but is not observed.
* Single newlines become <br> tags, just as in traditional RedCloth and other Textile parsers.
* HTML embedded in the Textile input does not ordinarily need to be escaped from Textile parsing.
* A single line can be skipped by the parser by prepending a space.
* Rudimentary support for LaTeX is built in.
* Output (less newlines and tabs) is identical to Textile 2 except a few cases where the RedCloth
  way was preferable.
